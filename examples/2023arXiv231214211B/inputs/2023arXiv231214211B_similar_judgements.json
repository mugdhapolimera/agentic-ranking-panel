  "abstract": "Open-source Large Language Models enable projects such as NASA SciX (i.e., NASA ADS) to think out of the box and try alternative approaches for information retrieval and data augmentation, while respecting data copyright and users' privacy. However, when large language models are directly prompted with questions without any context, they are prone to hallucination. At NASA SciX we have developed an experiment where we created semantic vectors for our large collection of abstracts and full-text content, and we designed a prompt system to ask questions using contextual chunks from our system. Based on a non-systematic human evaluation, the experiment shows a lower degree of hallucination and better responses when using Retrieval Augmented Generation. Further exploration is required to design new features and data augmentation processes at NASA SciX that leverages this technology while respecting the high level of trust and quality that the project holds.",

However, when these models are directly presented with questions lacking context, they become susceptible to generating inaccurate or fictional responses (hallucinations). To address this issue, we have conducted an experiment at NASA SciX: we generated semantic vectors for our extensive collection of abstracts and full-text content, and we devised a prompt system that relies on contextual chunks of text from our corpus to answer questions. Based on manual human evaluation, the results of the experiment seem to show a reduction in hallucination and improved responses when employing a self-reflective approach. NASA SciX will continue to explore the limits of this technology to fully capitalize it while upholding the project's esteemed level of trust and quality.",

The ever-increasing volume of scientific literature ingested in the system has made finding relevant sources more difficult, and thus new techniques are needed to improve discovery. ADS has been exploring new methods, aided by artificial intelligence, to assist with information retrieval and data enrichment. One information retrieval experiment we've undertaken has involved open source Large Language Models (LLMs). We calculated semantic vectors for our vast array of abstracts and full-text documents, pairing this database with a LLM-powered chatbot to create a query mechanism that utilizes contextual text snippets from our database for answering inquiries more factually than an LLM alone can. We've also partnered with external collaborators working on LLMs, providing curated datasets of open-access sources to assist with training AI models; we will discuss one such dataset, the Open Corpus, in more detail. Finally, we've undertaken an array of AI-informed data enrichment tasks for individual papers. These include automated classification of papers into broad categories, such as astronomy or planetary science, as well as assignment of keywords from curated taxonomies such as the Unified Astronomy Thesaurus and the Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature.",

It provides bibliographic information daily, or near daily, to a majority of astronomical researchers worldwide. We describe the history of the development of the system and its current status. Urania (Boyce 1996), and the ADS role in the emerging electronic astronomical data environment are discussed. Astronomy is unique in that it already has a fully functional data resource, where several of the most important data sources exist on-line and inter-operate nearly seamlessly. The ADS and the Strasbourg Data Center (CDS; Genova et~al. 2000) form the core of this resource. We show several examples of how to use the ADS, and we show how ADS use has increased as a function of time. Currently it is still increasing exponentially, with a doubling time for number of queries of 17 months. Using the ADS logs we make the first detailed model of how scientific journals are read as a function of time since publication. We find four distinct components. We directly compare the readership rate with the citation rate for scientific articles as a function of age. Citations generally follow reads, but there are some differences. The main journals of astronomy have differences in the ways they are read and cited. We discuss these from a number of different aspects. The impact of the ADS on astronomy can be calculated after making some simple assumptions. We find that the ADS increases the efficiency of astronomical research by 333 Full Time Equivalent (2000 hour) research years per year, and that the value of the early development of the ADS for astronomy, compared with waiting for mature technologies to be adopted, is 2332 FTE research years. A full technical description of the ADS is in three companion articles: \\cite{gei}, \\cite{aa}, and \\cite{csg}. The ADS is available at http://adsabs.harvard.edu/.",

Over the past 30 years, the ADS has gone from being an astronomy-focused bibliographic database to an open digital library system supporting research in space and (soon) earth sciences. This paper describes the evolution of the ADS system, its capabilities, and the technological infrastructure underpinning it. We give an overview of the ADS's original architecture, constructed primarily around simple database models. This bespoke system allowed for the efficient indexing of metadata and citations, the digitization and archival of full-text articles, and the rapid development of discipline-specific capabilities running on commodity hardware. The move towards a cloud-based microservices architecture and an open-source search engine in the late 2010s marked a significant shift, bringing full-text search capabilities, a modern API, higher uptime, more reliable data retrieval, and integration of advanced visualizations and analytics. Another crucial evolution came with the gradual and ongoing incorporation of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing algorithms in our data pipelines. Originally used for information extraction and classification tasks, NLP and ML techniques are now being developed to improve metadata enrichment, search, notifications, and recommendations. we describe how these computational techniques are being embedded into our software infrastructure, the challenges faced, and the benefits reaped. Finally, we conclude by describing the future prospects of ADS and its ongoing expansion, discussing the challenges of managing an interdisciplinary information system in the era of AI and Open Science, where information is abundant, technology is transformative, but their trustworthiness can be elusive.",

Through collaborative efforts at ESA and in the Universe TBD consortium, we strive to make science research more accessible. A key objective has been tailoring foundation models for specialised fields, to overcome the limitation of general-purpose foundation models such as generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models. To this end, we developed specialised LLMs for astronomy, AstroLLaMa-1 (Nguyen et al. 2023) and AstroLLaMA-Chat (Perkowski, Pan et al. 2024). These models, enriched by domain-specific data from the NASA ADS and ArXiv, demonstrate improved text completion and embedding capabilities over existing generative pre-trained transformer models. We will discuss the potential of large language models in generating hypothesis and extracting meaningful insights from astronomy literature. Our findings demonstrate the capability of LLMs in contributing to informed critique (Ciuca et al. 2023) and in revealing intriguing patterns in the embedding space, highlighting the potential of LLMs to augment scientific inquiry.

While ADS estimates our historic astronomy collection is over 80% complete, you may have something we are missing. If so, please help us ensure the whole literature of astronomy is freely accessible to everyone. <P />For ADS to accept historic material for scanning, it must be relevant to our mission and currently unavailable online.

This service is funded by NASA and is accessible world-wide through the World Wide Web free without restrictions at: http://adswww.harvard.edu The ADS abstract service allows the searching of a database of abstracts. The abstracts can be searched through a sophisticated search engine by author, astronomical object, title, and text. Various logical combinations of the search terms can be selected. Search results can be filtered by journal, publication date, and other criteria. The search returns a list of references with titles, author lists, and scores that indicate how closely the reference matches the query. The returned references also include hyperlinks to other information where available (e.g. abstracts, full journal articles, data tables, electronic on-line publications, references, citations, lists of astronomical objects, etc.) The ADS article service provides access to full journal articles for all major and many smaller journals. We scan the journals that give us permission at a resolution of 600 dpi. The scans can then be retrieved either for viewing on-screen in gif format, or for printing in Postscript or PCL format. We currently have articles back to 1975 on-line. We plan to eventually scan most of the historical astronomical literature as well. We have recently included the preprints from the Los Alamos preprint server. they are available in a separate database through the same search engine as the other abstracts. Preprints are kept on-line for 6 months. The American Astronomical Society has purchased citation information for 100,000 articles from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). This allows us to include links to lists of references and citations in our results page for articles in this set. In order to improve access times for non-US users, we are mirroring the abstract service. We currently have mirrors at the CDS in Strasbourg, France, and at NAO in Tokyo, Japan. Both mirrors can be found from our main page. The mirror site in Japan also mirrors the article service. We are looking for other mirror sites, in particular a site in Germany. Another new feature is the Table of Contents query page. It allows our users to retrieve either the latest volume they they have not read or the latest published volume for a number of journals, depending on the user preference settings.

Such a task remains difficult because assessing whether a table is relevant to a problem does not always depend only on its content but also on the context, which is usually tribal knowledge known to the individual or team. While tools like data catalogs and academic data discovery systems target this problem, they rely on keyword search or more complex interfaces, limiting non-technical users' ability to find relevant data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers a unique opportunity for users to ask questions directly in natural language, making dataset discovery more intuitive, accessible, and efficient. In this paper, we introduce Pneuma, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to efficiently and effectively discover tabular data. Pneuma leverages large language models (LLMs) for both table representation and table retrieval. For table representation, Pneuma preserves schema and row-level information to ensure comprehensive data understanding. For table retrieval, Pneuma augments LLMs with traditional information retrieval techniques, such as full-text and vector search, harnessing the strengths of both to improve retrieval performance. To evaluate Pneuma, we generate comprehensive benchmarks that simulate table discovery workload on six real-world datasets including enterprise data, scientific databases, warehousing data, and open data. Our results demonstrate that Pneuma outperforms widely used table search systems (such as full-text search and state-of-the-art RAG systems) in accuracy and resource efficiency.",
