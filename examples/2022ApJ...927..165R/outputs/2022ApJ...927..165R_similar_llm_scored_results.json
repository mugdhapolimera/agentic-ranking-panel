  "abstract": "Current observational facilities have yet to conclusively detect 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) that fill in the evolutionary gap between seed black holes in the early universe and z ~ 0 supermassive black holes. Dwarf galaxies present an opportunity to reveal active IMBHs amidst persistent star formation. We introduce photoionization simulations tailored to address key physical uncertainties: coincident versus noncoincident mixing of IMBH and starlight excitation, open versus closed geometries of surrounding gas clouds, and different shapes of the spectral energy distribution of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We examine possible AGN emission line diagnostics in the optical and mid-IR, and find that the diagnostics are often degenerate with respect to the investigated physical uncertainties. In spite of these setbacks, and in contrast to recent work, we are able to show that [O III]/H\u03b2 typically remains bright for dwarf AGN powered by IMBHs down to 10<SUP>3</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>. Dwarf AGN are predicted to have inconsistent star-forming and Seyfert/LINER classifications using the most common optical diagnostics. In the mid-IR, [O IV] 25.9 \u03bcm and [Ar II] 6.98 \u03bcm are less sensitive to physical uncertainties than are optical diagnostics. Based on these emission lines, we provide several diagrams of mid-IR emission line diagnostic diagrams with demarcations for separating starbursts and AGN with varying levels of activity. The diagrams are valid over a wide range of ionization parameters and metallicities out to z ~ 0.1, so will prove useful for future JWST observations of local dwarf AGN in the search for IMBHs. We make our photoionization simulation suite freely available. *Released on XXXX, XXXX, 2021",

      "title": "Emission Line Diagnostics for IMBHs in Dwarf Galaxies: Accounting for BH Seeding and ULX Excitation",
      "abstract": "Dwarf AGN serve as the ideal systems for identifying intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) down to the most elusive regimes ($\\sim 10^3 - 10^4 M_{\\odot}$). However, the ubiquitously metal-poor nature of dwarf galaxies gives rise to ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that can mimic the spectral signatures of IMBH excitation. We present a novel photoionization model suite that simultaneously incorporates IMBHs and ULXs in a metal-poor, highly star-forming environment. We account for changes in $M_{BH}$ according to formation seeding channels and metallicity, and changes in ULX populations with post-starburst age and metallicity. We find that broadband X-rays and UV emission lines are insensitive to $M_{BH}$ and largely unable to distinguish between ULXs and IMBHs. Many optical diagnostic diagrams cannot correctly identify dwarf AGN. The notable exceptions include He~II~$\u03bb$4686 and [O~I]~$\u03bb$6300, for which we redefine typical demarcations to account for ULX contributions. Emission lines in the mid-IR show the most promise in separating stellar, ULX, IMBH, and shock excitation while presenting sensitivity to $M_{BH}$ and $f_{\\text{AGN}}$. Overall, our results expose the potential biases in identifying and characterizing dwarf AGN purely on strong line ratios and diagnostic diagrams rather than holistically evaluating the entire spectrum. As a proof of concept, we argue that recently discovered over-massive BHs in high-$z$ JWST AGN might not represent the overall BH population, with many galaxies in these samples potentially being falsely classified as purely star-forming.",

      "abstract": "Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) in the range 10<SUP>3</SUP> - 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> have notoriously evaded detection, preventing important constraints on black hole seed mechanisms and the black hole occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies. Photoionization simulations are a useful tool for predicting signatures of IMBH activity in local dwarfs and high-z galaxies so IMBHs can be detected by current and future observational facilities. Unfortunately due to nondetection, much uncertainty exists about the physical conditions present in galaxies that harbor IMBHs, including the shape of the IMBH SED, the proper mixing of non-thermal and starlight excitation, and the geometry of the gas surrounding the IMBH. We compute a vast suite of models that account for these often overlooked uncertainties while covering a broad range of metallicities, ionization parameters, and AGN fractions. We show emission line predictions for common AGN diagnostics, like those in the BPT diagram, are not only profoundly affected by these variables in the ~10<SUP>3</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> regime, but also include degeneracies that make it difficult to impose simple diagnostic relations for AGN activity. In spite of these setbacks, the [O IV] 25.9 micron line remains a promising choice for constraining AGN activity over a wide range of physical conditions with JWST.

      "abstract": "Galaxy scaling relationships such as the stellar mass and nuclear black hole (BH) mass relationship imply that galaxies and BHs co-evolve. Our project seeks to understand low-z, low mass (dwarf) galaxies, which serve as laboratories for early universe galaxies, to infer conclusions about nuclear BH growth. While stellar-mass BHs and SMBHs are commonly identified, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) (10<SUP>3</SUP> - 10<SUP>5</SUP> solar masses) thought to reside in dwarf galaxies, remain elusive. Compared to SMBHs, the small sizes and similarly large distances from Earth make dynamic IMBH detections difficult, so active galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures provide an easier way to locate them in dwarf galaxies. However, dwarf galaxies also contain other X-ray emitters, such as ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), that can mimic the signatures expected from dwarf AGN. We use self-consistent photoionization models of dwarf galaxies as a function of post-starburst age and metallicity, which include spectral contributions from stars, AGN, and ULXs, to quantify each source's contribution to the composite spectral energy distribution (SED). Analysis of the photoionization models shows that at solar metallicity, an AGN fraction of 0.04 is enough to completely mask any contribution from ULXs at energies above 54 eV. However, dwarf galaxies are ubiquitously metal-poor. Our models show that at sub-solar metallicities, ULXs continue to influence the ionizing spectrum above 54 eV until the AGN fraction reaches 16%. These findings have implications for emission line diagnostics, such as He II 1640 A, He II 4686 A, and O I 6300 A, to distinguish between AGN and ULX contributions in dwarf galaxies at various metallicities. Our results suggest that sources with strong He II or O I emission, or with an inferred AGN fraction greater than 0.16, should be subject to minimal ULX contamination. These results also have implications for recent JWST observations that show high-z galaxies with O I and He II rest-frame optical spectra. Using our results, researchers with access to high-z JWST observations can constrain the light contribution differences between AGN and ULXs, in the search for IMBHs.",

We show that Seyferts and low-ionization narrow emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus-HII (AGN-HII) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [OIII] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [OIII] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[OIII]/\u03c3<SUP>4</SUP>, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixed L[OIII]/\u03c3<SUP>4</SUP>, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/L<SUB>EDD</SUB> and Seyferts dominant at high L/L<SUB>EDD</SUB>. These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than required by Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.",

      "abstract": "If intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) grow efficiently in gas discs around supermassive black holes, their host active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs should exhibit myriad observational signatures. Gap-opening IMBHs in AGN discs can exhibit spectral features and variability analogous to gapped protoplanetary discs. A gap-opening IMBH in the innermost disc imprints ripples and oscillations on the broad Fe K\u03b1 line which may be detectable with future X-ray missions. A non-gap-opening IMBH will accrete and produce a soft X-ray excess relative to continuum emission. An IMBH on a retrograde orbit in an AGN disc will not open a gap and will generate soft X-rays from a bow-shock `headwind'. Accreting IMBH in a large cavity can generate ULX-like X-ray luminosities and LINER-like optical line ratios from local ionized gas. We propose that many LINERs house a weakly accreting MBH binary in a large central disc cavity and will be luminous sources of gravitational waves (GW). IMBHs in galactic nuclei may also be detected via intermittent observational signatures including: UV/X-ray flares due to tidal disruption events, asymmetric X-ray intensity distributions as revealed by AGN transits, quasi-periodic oscillations and underluminous Type Ia supernovae. GW emitted during IMBH inspiral and collisions may be detected with eLISA and LIGO, particularly from LINERs.

      "abstract": "Line ratio diagnostics provide valuable clues as to the source of ionizing radiation in galaxies with intense black hole accretion and starbursting events, such as local Seyfert galaxies or galaxies at the peak of their star formation history. We aim to provide a reference joint optical and mid-IR line ratio analysis for studying active galactic nucleus (AGN) identification via line-ratio diagnostics and testing predictions from photoionization models. We first obtained homogenous optical spectra with the Southern Africa Large Telescope for 42 Seyfert galaxies with available Spitzer/IRS spectroscopy, along with X-ray to mid-IR multiband data. After confirming the power of the main optical ([O III]\u03bb5007) and mid-IR ([Ne V]14.3 \u03bcm, [O IV]25.9 \u03bcm, [Ne III]15.7 \u03bcm) emission lines in tracing AGN activity, we explored diagrams based on ratios of optical and mid-IR lines by exploiting photoionization models of different ionizing sources (AGN, star formation, and shocks). We find that pure AGN photoionization models are good at reproducing observations of Seyfert galaxies with an AGN fractional contribution to the mid-IR (5 \u2212 40 \u03bcm) continuum emission larger than 50 per cent. For targets with a lower AGN contribution, even assuming a hard ionizing field from the central accretion disk (F<SUB>\u03bd</SUB> \u221d \u03bd<SUP>\u03b1</SUP>, with \u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.9), these same models do not fully reproduce the observed mid-IR line ratios.

An additional source of ionization, either from star formation or radiative shocks, can help explain the observations in the mid-IR. While mid-IR line ratios are good tracers of the AGN activity versus star formation, among the combinations of optical and mid-IR diagnostics in line-ratio diagrams, only those involving the [O I]/H\u03b1 ratio are promising diagnostics for simultaneously unraveling the relative roles of AGN, star formation, and shocks.

This galaxy, denoted here as CEERS_1019, was previously discovered as a Ly\u03b1-break galaxy by Hubble with a Ly\u03b1 redshift from Keck. As part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey, we have observed this source with JWST/NIRSpec, MIRI, NIRCam, and NIRCam/WFSS and uncovered a plethora of emission lines. The H\u03b2 line is best fit by a narrow plus a broad component, where the latter is measured at 2.5\u03c3 with an FWHM ~1200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We conclude this originates in the broadline region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN).

The implied mass of the black hole (BH) is log (M <SUB>BH</SUB>/M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>) = 6.95 \u00b1 0.37, and we estimate that it is accreting at 1.2 \u00b1 0.5 times the Eddington limit.

We fit galaxy and AGN SED models to derive redshifts and physical properties; the sample spans $z\\sim5$-$9$ after removing brown dwarf contaminants. We consider two extreme physical scenarios: either LRDs are all AGN, and their continuum emission is dominated by the accretion disk, or they are all compact star-forming galaxies, and their continuum is dominated by stars.

The median SEDs of both HBL and type 2 AGN are affected by starlight contamination in the optical/UV. The median SED of HBL AGN is consistent with that of Seyfert 1s, when an extinction of A <SUB> V </SUB> \u223c 1.2 mag is applied. The comprehensive SEDs allowed us to measure accurate bolometric luminosities and derive robust bolometric corrections for the different tracers. The 12 \u03bcm and K-band nuclear luminosities have good linear correlations with the bolometric luminosity, similar to those in the X-rays. We derive bolometric corrections for either continuum bands (K band, 12 \u03bcm, 2\u201310 keV, and 14\u2013195 keV) or narrow emission lines (mid-IR high-ionization lines of [O IV] and [Ne V] and optical [O III] 5007 \u00c5) as well as for combinations of IR continuum and line emission. A combination of continuum plus line emission accurately predicts the bolometric luminosity up to quasar luminosities (\u223c10<SUP>46</SUP> erg s<SUP>\u20111</SUP>).",
