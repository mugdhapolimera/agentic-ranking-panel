  "individual_scores": {
    "1": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "Highly relevant as it directly addresses emission line diagnostics for IMBHs in dwarf galaxies, includes ULX contamination modeling, and discusses optical/mid-IR degeneracies. Aligns closely with the main paper's focus on uncertainties in AGN identification and photoionization simulations."
    },
    "2": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "Closely aligned with the main paper's methodology, exploring mid-IR diagnostics (e.g., [O IV]) and JWST applications. Both papers address uncertainties in IMBH detection and propose diagnostic diagrams, making this a strong match."
    },
    "3": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Relevant due to its focus on AGN vs. ULX differentiation in dwarf galaxies and photoionization modeling, but emphasizes X-ray/UV diagnostics more than optical/mid-IR. Overlaps in metallicity and AGN fraction analysis but less methodologically aligned with the main paper."
    },
    "4": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Tangential; focuses on LINER/Seyfert host galaxy properties using SDSS data, not dwarf galaxies or IMBHs. While AGN classification is related, the scope and targets differ significantly from the main paper."
    },
    "5": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Discusses IMBHs in AGN discs and LINERs but focuses on X-ray/gas dynamics rather than emission line diagnostics. Limited overlap with the main paper's optical/mid-IR diagnostics and dwarf galaxy context."
    },
    "6": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Relevant for its joint optical/mid-IR line ratio analysis and photoionization model testing, but targets Seyfert galaxies rather than dwarfs. Provides complementary insights but lacks IMBH-specific focus."
    },
    "7": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Describes a high-z AGN discovery with JWST but focuses on SMBH growth rather than IMBHs in local dwarfs. No direct relevance to the main paper's diagnostic diagrams or dwarf galaxy context."
    },
    "8": {
      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "Not relevant; focuses on high-z 'little red dots' and SMBHs in COSMOS-Web, unrelated to local dwarf galaxies or IMBH diagnostics. Context and targets differ entirely."
    },
    "9": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Relevant for studying IMBH candidates in dwarfs but uses variability (ZTF/WISE) rather than emission line diagnostics. Shares the goal of IMBH detection but diverges methodologically from the main paper."
    },
    "10": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Tangential; analyzes bolometric luminosities of AGN in a 12\u03bcm sample, not IMBHs or dwarf galaxies. Overlaps in SED modeling but lacks focus on diagnostic line ratios or JWST applications."

  "overall_analysis": {
    "strengths": [
      "Results 1 and 2 provide direct methodological and topical alignment with the main paper, focusing on photoionization models, mid-IR diagnostics, and JWST applications.",
      "Results 3 and 6 offer insights into AGN/ULX differentiation and optical/mid-IR line ratios, supporting the main paper's goals."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Several results (4, 5, 7, 8, 10) are too general, target different galaxy populations, or use unrelated methodologies (e.g., X-ray, variability).",
      "Limited exploration of JWST-specific diagnostics outside Results 1 and 2."
    ],
    "suggestions": [
      "Include more studies on mid-IR diagnostics in metal-poor environments specific to dwarf galaxies.",
      "Expand comparisons with high-z AGN studies to contextualize IMBH formation scenarios.",
      "Integrate multi-wavelength approaches (e.g., combining variability and line-ratio diagnostics) for robust IMBH identification."
