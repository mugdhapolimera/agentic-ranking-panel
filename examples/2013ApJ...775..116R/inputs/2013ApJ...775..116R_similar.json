Utilizing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 and stellar masses from the NASA-Sloan Atlas, we have systematically searched for active BHs in ~25,000 emission-line galaxies with stellar masses comparable to the Magellanic Clouds and redshifts z &lt; 0.055. Using the narrow-line [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [N II]/H\u03b1 diagnostic diagram, we find photoionization signatures of BH accretion in 136 galaxies, a small fraction of which also exhibit broad H\u03b1 emission. For these broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates, we estimate BH masses using standard virial techniques and find a range of 10<SUP>5</SUP> &lt;~ M <SUB>BH</SUB> &lt;~ 10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> and a median of M <SUB>BH</SUB> ~ 2 \u00d7 10<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>. We also detect broad H\u03b1 in 15 galaxies that have narrow-line ratios consistent with star-forming galaxies. Follow-up observations are required to determine if these are true type 1 AGN or if the broad H\u03b1 is from stellar processes. The median absolute magnitude of the host galaxies in our active sample is M<SUB>g</SUB> = -18.1 mag, which is ~1-2 mag fainter than previous samples of AGN hosts with low-mass BHs.

Here we investigate the relationship between BH mass and host galaxy total stellar mass using a sample of 262 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the nearby universe (z &lt; 0.055), as well as 79 galaxies with dynamical BH masses. The vast majority of our AGN sample is constructed using Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and searching for Seyfert-like narrow-line ratios and broad H\u03b1 emission.

      "abstract": "Spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope has opened the possibility of identifying moderate-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe, at and beyond the epoch of re-ionisation, complementing previous surveys of much more luminous (and much rarer) quasars. We present 12 new AGNs at 4 &lt; z &lt; 7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z = 10.6) revealed through the detection of a broad-line region (BLR) seen in the Balmer emission lines. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower-mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases, we find evidence for two broad components of H\u03b1, which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs), although a complex BLR geometry cannot be excluded. The inferred BH masses range from 8 \u00d7 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> down to 4 \u00d7 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, interestingly probing the regime expected for direct collapse BHs. The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities (\u223c10<SUP>44</SUP> \u2011 10<SUP>45</SUP> erg/s) imply accretion rates that are &lt; 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BHs, with M<SUB>BH</SUB> \u223c 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BHs at z \u223c 4\u201311 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies' stellar masses when compared to the local M<SUB>BH</SUB> \u2011 M<SUB>star</SUB> relation, even approaching M<SUB>BH</SUB> \u223c M<SUB>star</SUB>, as was expected from heavy BH seeds and/or super-Eddington accretion scenarios. However, we find that these early BHs tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M<SUB>BH</SUB> and velocity dispersion, as well as between M<SUB>BH</SUB> and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the classical, optical narrow-line excitation-diagnostic diagrams, these AGNs are located in the region that is locally occupied by star-forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what is expected for AGNs hosted in metal-poor galaxies (Z \u223c 0.1 \u2011 0.2 Z<SUB>\u2299</SUB>). The fraction of broad-line AGNs with L<SUB>AGN</SUB> &gt; 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg/s among galaxies in the redshift range of 4 &lt; z &lt; 6 is about 10%, suggesting that the contribution of AGNs and their hosts to the re-ionisation of the Universe is &gt; 10%.",

For this purpose, we developed a set of elaborate, automated selection procedures and applied it uniformly to the Fourth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Special attention is given to AGN-galaxy spectral decomposition and emission-line deblending.

About half of our sample of low-mass BHs differs from that of Greene &amp; Ho, with 61 of them discovered here for the first time. Our new sample picks up more AGNs with low accretion rates: the Eddington ratios of the present sample range from &lt;~ 0.01 to ~1, with 30% below 0.1. This suggests that a significant fraction of low-mass BHs in the local universe are accreting at low rates. The host galaxies of the low-mass BHs have luminosities similar to those of L* field galaxies, optical colors of Sbc spirals, and stellar spectral features consistent with a continuous star formation history with a mean stellar age of less than 1 Gyr.",

The AGNs were selected using several optical emission-line diagnostics after careful modeling of the continuum present in the spectra. We have limited our survey to objects with spectral characteristics similar to those of Seyfert nuclei, excluding emission-line galaxies with ambiguous spectra that could be powered by stellar processes. Thus, as a set, the host galaxies in our sample are the least massive objects in the very local universe certain to contain central black holes. Our sample is dominated by narrow-line (type 2) AGNs, and it appears to have a much lower fraction of broad-line objects than that observed for luminous, optically selected Seyfert galaxies. Given our focus on the nearest objects included in the SDSS, our survey is more sensitive to low-luminosity emission than previous optical searches for AGNs in low-mass galaxies. The [O iii] \u03bb 5007 luminosities of the Seyfert nuclei in our sample have a median value of {{L}<SUB>5007</SUB>}=2\u00d7 {{10}<SUP>5</SUP>} {{L}<SUB>\u2299 </SUB>} and extend down to \u223c {{10}<SUP>4</SUP>} {{L}<SUB>\u2299 </SUB>}.

Applying this correction to our sample, we obtain minimum black hole mass estimates that fall mainly in the 10<SUP>3</SUP> {{M}<SUB>\u2299 </SUB>}-10<SUP>4</SUP> {{M}<SUB>\u2299 </SUB>} range, which is roughly where the predicted mass functions for different black hole seed formation scenarios overlap the most.

Our study is primarily focused on those objects with narrow emission line ratios dominated by star formation, for which the origin of the broad H\u03b1 emission was unclear. Based on follow-up spectroscopy, we find that the broad H\u03b1 emission has faded or was ambiguous for all of the star-forming objects (14/16), over baselines ranging from 5-14 years, suggesting a transient stellar process was responsible for the broad emission in previous Sloan Digital Sky Survey observations. For the two objects in our follow-up sample with narrow-line AGN signatures (RGG 9 and RGG 119), we find persistent broad H\u03b1 emission consistent with an AGN origin. Additionally, we use high spectral resolution observations to measure stellar velocity dispersions for 15 objects in the Reines et al.

We find that 13 dwarf galaxies almost certainly host active massive BHs, despite the fact that only one object was previously identified as having optical signatures of an AGN. We also identify a candidate dual radio AGN in a more massive galaxy system. The majority of the radio-detected BHs are offset from the center of the host galaxies, with some systems showing signs of interactions/mergers. Our results indicate that massive BHs need not always live in the nuclei of dwarf galaxies, confirming predictions from simulations.

To recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey emission-line catalogs overlapping the volume- and mass-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntex (ECO) surveys to determine the AGN percentage in SEL dwarfs. Our photoionization grids show that the [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [S II]/H\u03b1 diagram (S II plot) and [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [O I]/H\u03b1 diagram (O I plot) are less metallicity sensitive and more successful in identifying dwarf AGN than the popular [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [N II]/H\u03b1 diagnostic (N II plot or \"BPT diagram\"). We identify a new category of \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN) classified as star-forming by the N II plot but as AGN by the S II and/or O I plots. Including SF-AGN, we find the z ~ 0 AGN percentage in dwarfs with SELs to be ~3%-16%, far exceeding most previous optical estimates (~1%). The large range in our dwarf AGN percentage reflects differences in spectral fitting methodologies between catalogs. The highly complete nature of RESOLVE and ECO allows us to normalize strong emission-line galaxy statistics to the full galaxy population, reducing the dwarf AGN percentage to ~0.6%-3.0%.

This galaxy, denoted here as CEERS_1019, was previously discovered as a Ly\u03b1-break galaxy by Hubble with a Ly\u03b1 redshift from Keck. As part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey, we have observed this source with JWST/NIRSpec, MIRI, NIRCam, and NIRCam/WFSS and uncovered a plethora of emission lines. The H\u03b2 line is best fit by a narrow plus a broad component, where the latter is measured at 2.5\u03c3 with an FWHM ~1200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We conclude this originates in the broadline region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN).
