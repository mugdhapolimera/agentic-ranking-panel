        "1": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "Highly relevant. The paper identifies low-mass AGNs in dwarf galaxies using multi-diagnostic emission-line analysis and virial BH mass estimates, directly aligning with the main paper's focus on optical signatures of AGNs in low-mass galaxies. The methodology (SDSS data, emission-line diagnostics, broad Hα) and mass range (10^5-10^6 M⊙) closely match the main paper."
        },
        "2": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "Relevant but broader in scope. While it investigates BH-galaxy scaling relations and includes low-mass BHs, the focus is on the M_BH-M_stellar relation across all masses rather than specifically identifying AGNs in dwarfs. The overlap in BH mass range and use of SDSS data make it partially aligned."
        },
        "3": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "Partially relevant. The paper studies low-mass BHs at high redshift (z=4-11) using JWST, which differs from the main paper's local universe focus. However, the discussion of BH over-massiveness relative to hosts and challenges in optical diagnostics (e.g., metal-poor AGNs) connects to the main paper's themes."
        },
        "4": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "Highly relevant. This work systematically identifies low-mass BHs in Seyfert 1 galaxies using SDSS, virial mass estimates, and optical diagnostics. The sample (M_BH ~10^5-10^6 M⊙) and focus on AGN selection in low-mass hosts closely mirror the main paper's goals."
        },
        "5": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "Highly relevant. This study confirms AGNs in nearby dwarfs using SDSS emission-line diagnostics and discusses BH masses (10^3-10^4 M⊙) and AGN fractions, directly addressing the main paper's focus on optical signatures of low-mass BHs in dwarfs."
        },
        "6": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "Relevant but narrower in focus. The paper evaluates transient vs. persistent broad Hα emission in dwarf AGN candidates, addressing a specific uncertainty in the main paper's methodology. While critical for validation, it is a follow-up study rather than a primary identification effort."
        },
        "7": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "Partially relevant. The radio-based identification of off-nuclear BHs in dwarfs introduces a complementary method but diverges from the main paper's optical diagnostics. The focus on non-nuclear BHs is novel but less aligned with the main paper's central theme."
        },
        "8": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "Highly relevant. This work confirms AGNs in dwarfs using X-ray/UV data, validating optical signatures. The overlap in sample selection (Reines et al. 2013) and BH mass range (10^4-10^6 M⊙) strongly supports the main paper's findings."
        },
        "9": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "Highly relevant. This paper develops optimized emission-line diagnostics (e.g., [S II]/Hα and [O I]/Hα diagrams) to identify dwarf AGNs, directly addressing the main paper's methodological core. The focus on low-metallicity AGNs and SF-AGN classification is closely aligned."
        },
        "10": {
            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "Marginally relevant. While it discusses a low-mass BH (log M_BH ~6.95) in a high-redshift galaxy, the focus on z=8.679 and JWST data diverges from the main paper's local universe context. The connection to BH seeding is tangential."

    "overall_analysis": {
        "strengths": [
            "Multiple results (1, 4, 5, 8, 9) directly align with the main paper's focus on optical AGN identification in dwarfs, using similar methodologies (SDSS, emission-line diagnostics, virial masses).",
            "Results 6 and 8 provide critical validation (multi-epoch spectroscopy and X-ray data) for AGN persistence and accretion, strengthening the main paper's conclusions.",
            "Result 9's optimized diagnostics offer a methodological advancement directly applicable to the main paper's goals."
        ],
        "weaknesses": [
            "Results 3 and 10 focus on high-redshift AGNs, which are less relevant to the main paper's local universe context.",
            "Result 7's radio-based approach, while innovative, diverges from the optical methodology central to the main paper.",
            "Result 2's broad scaling-relation focus dilutes its relevance to the specific topic of dwarf AGN identification."
        ],
        "suggestions": [
            "Prioritize studies that explicitly address optical diagnostics and low-mass BH identification in the local universe.",
            "Include multi-wavelength confirmations (e.g., X-ray, radio) to strengthen AGN validation in future work.",
            "Explore the interplay between metallicity and AGN detectability in dwarf galaxies, as hinted in Results 3 and 9."
