        "1": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant to the main paper as it also focuses on finding low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies using emission line diagnostics from the GAMA survey. The methodology and goals align closely with the main paper."},
        "2": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant as it investigates the relationship between black hole mass and total stellar mass of the host galaxy using a sample of broad-line AGN, including some in dwarf galaxies. However, it does not specifically focus on optimizing emission line diagnostics for low-metallicity dwarfs like the main paper."},
        "3": {"score": 1, "explanation": "While this result discusses AGN at high redshifts and their contribution to reionization, it does not directly relate to the methodology of identifying AGN in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies using optimized emission line diagnostics, which is the main focus of the paper."},
        "4": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant as it presents a uniformly selected sample of low-mass black holes in Seyfert 1 galaxies using emission line diagnostics from SDSS. However, it does not specifically optimize the diagnostics for low-metallicity dwarf galaxies like the main paper."},
        "5": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it focuses on identifying AGN in nearby low-mass dwarf galaxies using emission line diagnostics from SDSS, which aligns closely with the goals and methodology of the main paper."},
        "6": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant as it uses time-domain spectroscopy to distinguish between AGN and stellar processes for broad emission lines in dwarf galaxies, including some from the Reines et al. (2013) sample used in the main paper. However, it does not directly optimize emission line diagnostics for low-metallicity dwarfs."},
        "7": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it presents a new sample of accreting massive black holes in nearby dwarf galaxies identified through high-resolution radio observations, which complements the optical emission line diagnostics used in the main paper."},
        "8": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it presents X-ray and UV observations of the optically-selected AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies from the Reines et al. (2013) sample, which is also used in the main paper. It provides additional evidence for the presence of accreting black holes in these systems."},
        "9": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This is the main paper being evaluated."},
        "10": {"score": 1, "explanation": "While this result discusses the discovery of a high-redshift AGN, it does not directly relate to the methodology of identifying AGN in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies using optimized emission line diagnostics, which is the main focus of the paper."}
