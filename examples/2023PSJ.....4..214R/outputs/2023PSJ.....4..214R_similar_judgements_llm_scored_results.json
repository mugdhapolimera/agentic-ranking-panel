  "abstract": "The Didymos binary asteroid was the target of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, which intentionally impacted Dimorphos, the smaller member of the binary system. We used the Near-Infrared Spectrograph and Mid-Infrared Instrument instruments on JWST to measure the 0.6-5 and 5-20 \u03bcm spectra of Didymos approximately two months after the DART impact. These observations confirm that Didymos belongs to the S asteroid class and is most consistent with LL chondrite composition, as was previously determined from its 0.6-2.5 \u03bcm reflectance spectrum. Measurements at wavelengths &gt;2.5 \u03bcm show Didymos to have thermal properties typical for an S-complex asteroid of its size and to be lacking absorptions deeper than ~2% due to OH or H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Didymos' mid-infrared emissivity spectrum is within the range of what has been measured on S-complex asteroids observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope and is most consistent with emission from small (&lt;25 \u03bcm) surface particles. We conclude that the observed reflectance and physical properties make the Didymos system a good proxy for the type of ordinary chondrite asteroids that cross near-Earth space, and a good representative of likely future impactors.",

      "abstract": "We present JWST near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby normal Type Ia supernova (SN) SN 2021aefx in the nebular phase at +255 days past maximum light. Our Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid Infrared Instrument observations, combined with ground-based optical data from the South African Large Telescope, constitute the first complete optical+NIR+MIR nebular SN Ia spectrum covering 0.3-14 \u03bcm. This spectrum unveils the previously unobserved 2.5-5 \u03bcm region, revealing strong nebular iron and stable nickel emission, indicative of high-density burning that can constrain the progenitor mass. The data show a significant improvement in sensitivity and resolution compared to previous Spitzer MIR data. We identify numerous NIR and MIR nebular emission lines from iron-group elements as well as lines from the intermediate-mass element argon. The argon lines extend to higher velocities than the iron-group elements, suggesting stratified ejecta that are a hallmark of delayed-detonation or double-detonation SN Ia models. We present fits to simple geometric line profiles to features beyond 1.2 \u03bcm and find that most lines are consistent with Gaussian or spherical emission distributions, while the [Ar III] 8.99 \u03bcm line has a distinctively flat-topped profile indicating a thick spherical shell of emission. Using our line profile fits, we investigate the emissivity structure of SN 2021aefx and measure kinematic properties. Continued observations of SN 2021aefx and other SNe Ia with JWST will be transformative to the study of SN Ia composition, ionization structure, density, and temperature, and will provide important constraints on SN Ia progenitor and explosion models.",

However, previous analyses of WASP-17b's atmosphere based upon Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer data could not constrain the water abundance, finding that subsolar, supersolar, and bimodal posterior distributions were all statistically valid. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot Jupiter WASP-17b using JWST's Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode. We analyze our data using three independent data analysis pipelines, finding excellent agreement between results. Our transmission spectrum shows multiple H<SUB>2</SUB>O absorption features and a flatter slope towards the optical than seen in previous HST observations. We analyze our spectrum using both PICASO + Virga forward models and free retrievals. POSEIDON retrievals provide a well-constrained supersolar log(H<SUB>2</SUB>O) abundance (\u20112.96<inline-formula> </inline-formula>), breaking the degeneracy from the previous HST + Spitzer analysis. We verify our POSEIDON results with petitRADTRANS retrievals.

This unique interacting object provides an opportunity to probe the mass-loss history of a stripped-envelope SN progenitor. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we observed SN 2014C with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer at 3477 days postexplosion (rest frame), and the Near-Infrared Spectrograph Integral Field Unit at 3568 days postexplosion, covering 1.7\u201325 \u03bcm. The bolometric luminosity indicates that the SN is still interacting with the same CSM that was observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope 40\u20131920 days postexplosion.

Both the binary system and the impact event were imaged by the Light Italian Cubesat for Imaging of Asteroids, detached from DART 15 days before the impact. Images from the onboard LUKE red, green, and blue camera together with ground-based observations enabled the reconstruction of Didymos's brightness phase curve, with phase angles ranging from 2.35\u00b0 to 107.7\u00b0. The opposition effect regime was studied using the exponential-linear equation, the \"Shevchenko\" function and the linear-by-parts model while the IAU-official HG1G2 magnitude system was applied to the full phase curve. The opposition effect indicates an unusual asteroid surface for an S type, with characteristics similar to M-type asteroids. While the HG1G2 parameters from the full phase curve place Didymos well among asteroids of the taxonomic C complex. Didymos's phase curve parameters when compared to near-Earth asteroids are very close to the Q type (1862) Apollo, indicating possible depletion of fine submicrometric grains through resurfacing. Didymos's geometric albedo (0.15 \u00b1 0.01) is reported to be 30%\u201345% smaller than the average geometric albedo for near-Earth S types (0.26 \u00b1 0.04). We propose that Didymos might be an LL ordinary chondrite analog containing albedo-suppressing, shock-darkened/impact melt minerals that have undergone resurfacing processes in the past. A comparison with meteorites indicates that, less likely, Didymos could also contain materials analog to carbon-bearing brecciated L3 ordinary chondrites.",

In this Letter, we measure the mid-infrared (5\u201312 \u03bcm) dayside emission spectrum of the benchmark hot Jupiter HD 189733 b with MIRI LRS by combining data from two secondary-eclipse observations.

Mid-infrared spectra were obtained for PDS 70 by the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2007 and 2022, respectively. In this work, we investigate the dust mineralogy through a detailed decomposition of the observed mid-infrared spectra. The results show that both the dust size and crystallinity increased by a factor of about two during the two epochs of observation, indicating evident dust processing in the terrestrial planet-forming region of the PDS 70 disk. The dust size (\u223c 0.8 \u00b5m) and crystallinity (\u223c 6%) in the PDS 70 disk are similar to those of other disks, which implies that the two nascent planets, PDS 70b and PDS 70c located at radial distances of \u223c 22 AU and \u223c 34 AU, do not have a significant impact on the dust processing in the inner disk.

      "abstract": "Jupiter Trojan asteroids (hereafter, Trojans) are a key small body population found in Jupiter's L4 and L5 Lagrange points and are dynamically stable over the lifetime of the Solar System. These primitive asteroids link together formation theories and dynamical models that explain how our Solar System formed. Trojans share important characteristics with the dynamically excited Kuiper Belt populations and Neptunian Trojans. As such, Trojans may be one of the most accessible examples of the planetesimals that populated the outer protoplanetary disk. Mid-Infrared (MIR; 5-35 \u00b5m) spectral analysis of fourteen Trojans indicates their regoliths are dominated by fine-particulate amorphous and crystalline silicates, and is consistent with outer solar system formation theories. However, the low albedos and generally featureless global near infrared (NIR; 0.7 \u2013 2.5 \u00b5m) spectra leave these objects mysterious still. Furthermore, the number of Trojans observed in the MIR remains extremely low compared to NIR observations. The Lucy mission, which launched in October of 2022, will be the first to explore the Trojan asteroids. Over the next ten years, Lucy will perform flybys of (3548) Eurybates, (15094) Polymele, (11351) Leucus, (21900) Orus, and (617) Patroclus and its binary Menoetius. MIR observations of the Lucy targets in concert with the Lucy mission will illuminate the Trojan's dynamic history and current mineralogy. Leucus, Orus, Eurybates, Polymele, and Patroclus were observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) in Medium Resolution spectroscopy (MRS) mode as part of the Cycle 1 GO program 2574 (PI M.

With the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS), we explore demographic trends among 31 disks observed with MIRI (MRS) and with previous ALMA millimeter continuum imaging at high angular resolution (5-10 au). With these S/N $\\sim$200-450 spectra, we report emission from H$_2$O, OH, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, CO$_2$, [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ar II]. Emission from H$_2$O, OH and CO is nearly ubiquitous for low-mass stars, and detection rates of all molecules are higher than for similar disks observed with Spitzer-IRS. Slab model fits to the molecular emission lines demonstrate that emission from C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and possibly CO$_2$ is optically thin; thus since column densities and emitting radii are degenerate, observations are actually sensitive to the total molecular mass. C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN emission also typically originate in a hotter region ($920^{+70}_{-130}$, $820^{+70}_{-130}$ K, respectively) than CO$_2$ ($600^{+200}_{-160}$ K). The HCN to cold H$_2$O luminosity ratios are generally smaller in smooth disks, consistent with more efficient water delivery via icy pebbles in the absence of large dust substructures. The molecular emission line luminosities are also correlated with mass accretion rates and infrared spectral indices, similar to trends reported from Spitzer-IRS surveys. This work demonstrates the power of combining multi-wavelength observations to explore inner disk chemistry as a function of outer disk and stellar properties, which will continue to grow as the sample of observed Class II systems expands in the coming JWST observation cycles.",

Before the DART impact, we performed visible and mid-infrared observations to constrain the pre-impact thermophysical properties of the Didymos system and to model its Yarkovsky effect. Analysis of the photometric phase curve derives a Bond albedo of 0.07 \u00b1 0.01, and a thermophysical analysis of the mid-infrared observations derives a thermal inertia of 320 \u00b1 70 J m<SUP>\u20112</SUP> K<SUP>\u20111</SUP> s<SUP>\u20111/2</SUP> and a thermal roughness of 40\u00b0 \u00b1 3\u00b0 rms slope.

This bulk density indicates that Didymos is spinning at or near its critical spin-limit at which self-gravity balances equatorial centrifugal forces. Furthermore, comparisons with the post-impact infrared observations presented in Rivkin et al. indicate no change in the thermal inertia of the Didymos system following the DART impact. Finally, orbital temperature simulations indicate that subsurface water ice is stable over geologic timescales in the polar regions if present.

      "abstract": "The study of primitive asteroid composition can give great insight to the origin and formation of the solar system as primitive asteroids are widely thought to have experienced little thermal processing. Despite visible/ near-infrared (VNIR) data being more abundant, certain features in the VNIR make the composition difficult to discern for asteroids, therefore pairing it with diagnostic mid-IR data allows us to learn more about any given object. Certain emission features such as the 10 \u00b5m plateau can indicate the presence and composition of silicates such as quartz and olivine. Driven by a desire to improve interpretations of future JWST asteroid data, we focus on investigating C-complex asteroids from archival Spitzer data. Following the works such as Humes et al. 2024, Martin et al. 2023a, Martin et al. 2023b, and Emery et al. 2006, we use Spitzer Heritage Archive mid-IR spectra taken with the infrared spectrograph to present new thermal emission spectra for 15 C-complex asteroids. These asteroids include 7 Iris, 12 Victoria, 24 Themis, 90 Antiope, 96 Aegle, 114 Kassandra, 130 Elektra, 234 Barbara, 261 Prymno, 334 Chicago, 379 Huenna, 433 Eros, 554 Peraga, 762 Pulcova, and 1373 Cincinnati. The spectra were created by reducing the data through the Spitzer IRS Custom Extraction Software (SPICE), fitting and scaling it using a polynomial fit, and finally running it through the Near Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM). The thermal model is used to convert the Spitzer spectral data into an emissivity spectrum. The shape of the 10 \u00b5m silicate emission feature was categorized using the methods of Martin et al. 2023 and values such as feature bounds, peak locations, and slopes were measured. Our findings clearly show the 10 \u00b5m silicate emission feature in many studied asteroids and our derived values agree, within error margins, with published diameters and band parameters. We compare the asteroids to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites within the ASTER spectral library (Baldridge et al. 2009) using a chi-squared goodness of fit test to observe similarities in overall spectra shape, physical properties, and predicted composition. We will discuss the band parameters as well as comparisons to the meteorites regarding possible compositions.",

Here, we report observations of boulders' fractures on Dimorphos, which is the moonlet of the S-complex asteroid (65803) Didymos, the target of NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) planetary defense mission. We show that the size-frequency distribution and orientation of the mapped fractures are consistent with formation through thermal fatigue. The fractures' preferential orientation supports that these have originated in situ on Dimorphos boulders and not on Didymos boulders later transferred to Dimorphos. Based on our model of the fracture propagation, we propose that thermal fatigue on rocks exposed on the surface of S-type asteroids can form shallow, horizontally propagating fractures in much shorter timescales (100 kyr) than in the direction normal to the boulder surface (order of Myrs). The presence of boulder fields affected by thermal fracturing on near-Earth asteroid surfaces may contribute to an enhancement in the ejected mass and momentum from kinetic impactors when deflecting asteroids.",

Ground-based visible and near-infrared (NIR; 0.4 to 2.5 \u03bcm) spectra of Sedna showed absorption near 2.3 \u03bcm previously ascribed to CH<SUB>4</SUB> and/or CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH ice, hints of H<SUB>2</SUB>O ice and a steep red spectral slope suggestive of complex organics. Photometry at 3.6 and 4.5 \u03bcm measured with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope indicated strong absorption bands relative to the 2-\u03bcm region and support spectral models that include H\u00ad<SUB>2</SUB>O ice and simple hydrocarbons. However, the low S/N of the NIR spectra and photometric nature of the IRAC data hinder detailed compositional analysis. With equilibrium temperatures of ~30 K and ~9 K at perihelion (~76AU) and aphelion (~937 AU), respectively, a wide range of ices should be stable on the surface. Sedna was observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) using the NIRSpec IFU in prism mode. The observations were part of GTO program 1272 (PI D. Hines) and occurred on Sept 13, 2022 (17:18-17:49 UT). The spectrum covers the wavelength range 0.7\u20135.3 \u03bcm with a spectral resolving power of ~100. H<SUB>2</SUB>O ice bands suggested in the ground-based spectra at 1.5 and 2.0 \u03bcm are confirmed, and distortions of the band shapes indicate significant contamination of the ice by other materials. The absorption band complex near 2.3 \u03bcm is revealed with significant substructure. At \u03bb &gt; 2.5 \u03bcm, the overall level of reflectance is consistent with the Spitzer/IRAC photometry. A broad and deep absorption from ~2.8 to 3.5 \u03bcm is likely due to H\u00ad<SUB>2</SUB>O ice, as is a gentle curvature at ~4\u20135 \u03bcm. Several narrower absorption bands throughout the NIRSpec prism wavelength range are consistent with ethane (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>6</SUB>) ice, including a very strong absorption complex near 3.4 \u03bcm. Interestingly, the strong absorption from methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>) at 3.3 \u03bcm is not apparent in the spectrum, nor does CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH appear to be present. We will present the JWST spectrum of Sedna in the context of the previous ground-based and Spitzer data and will present new spectral analyses. Eventually, comparison of the composition of Sedna to other dynamical classes of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) will address the context of IOC objects within the TNO population.",

Here, we summarize DART's achievement of those requirements. On 2022 September 26, the DART spacecraft impacted Dimorphos, the secondary member of the Didymos near-Earth asteroid binary system, demonstrating an autonomously navigated kinetic impact into an asteroid with limited prior knowledge for planetary defense. Months of subsequent Earth-based observations showed that the binary orbital period was changed by \u201333.24 minutes, with two independent analysis methods each reporting a 1\u03c3 uncertainty of 1.4 s. Dynamical models determined that the momentum enhancement factor, \u03b2, resulting from DART's kinetic impact test is between 2.4 and 4.9, depending on the mass of Dimorphos, which remains the largest source of uncertainty. Over five dozen telescopes across the globe and in space, along with the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, have contributed to DART's investigations. These combined investigations have addressed topics related to the ejecta, dynamics, impact event, and properties of both asteroids in the binary system. A year following DART's successful impact into Dimorphos, the mission has achieved its planetary defense requirements, although work to further understand DART's kinetic impact test and the Didymos system will continue. In particular, ESA's Hera mission is planned to perform extensive measurements in 2027 during its rendezvous with the Didymos\u2013Dimorphos system, building on DART to advance our knowledge and continue the ongoing international collaboration for planetary defense.",
