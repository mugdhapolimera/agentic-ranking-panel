  "abstract": "Multiple codes are available to derive atmospheric parameters and individual chemical abundances from high-resolution spectra of AFGKM stars. Almost all spectroscopists have their own preferences regarding which code and method to use. But the intrinsic differences between codes and methods lead to complex systematics that depend on multiple variables such as the selected spectral regions and the radiative transfer code used. I expand ISPEC, a popular open-source spectroscopic tool, to support the most well-known radiative transfer codes and assess their similarities and biases when using multiple set-ups based on the equivalent-width method and the synthetic spectral-fitting technique (interpolating from a pre-computed grid of spectra or synthesizing with interpolated model atmospheres). This work shows that systematic differences on atmospheric parameters and abundances between most of the codes can be reduced when using the same method and executing a careful spectral feature selection. However, it may not be possible to ignore the remaining differences, depending on the particular case and the required precision. Regarding methods, equivalent-width-based and spectrum-fitting analyses exhibit large differences that are caused by their intrinsic differences, which is significant given the popularity of these two methods. The results help to identify the key caveats of modern spectroscopy that all scientists should be aware of before trusting their own results or being tempted to combine atmospheric parameters and abundances from the literature.",

Searching for SB2s has been a hot topic in astronomy. Although considerable efforts have been made with fruitful outcomes, limitations in automation and accuracy still persist. In this study, we developed a convolutional neural network model to search for SB2 candidates in LAMOST medium-resolution survey (MRS) data release (DR) 9 v1.0 by detecting double peaks in the cross-correlation function (CCF). We first generated a large number of spectra of single stars and binaries using the iSpec spectral synthesis software. The CCFs of these synthesized spectra were then calculated to form our training set. To efficiently detect the peaks of the CCFs, we applied a Softmax function-based noise reduction method. After testing and validation, the model achieved an accuracy of 97.76% in the testing set and was validated for more than 90% of the sample in several published SB2 catalogs. Finally, by applying the model to examine approximately 1.59 million LAMOST-MRS DR9 spectra, we identified 728 candidate SB2s, including 281 newly discovered ones.",

The training set consists of a large set of mock spectra of single stars and binaries synthesized based on the MIST stellar evolutionary model and ATLAS9 atmospheric model. Our model reaches a novel theoretic false-positive rate by adding a proper penalty on the negative sample (e.g., 0.12% and 0.16% for the blue/red arm when the penalty parameter \u039b = 16). Tests show that the performance is as expected and favors FGK-type main-sequence (MS) binaries with high mass ratio (q \u2265 0.7) and large radial velocity separation (\u0394v \u2265 50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). Although the real false-positive rate cannot be estimated reliably, validating on eclipsing binaries identified from Kepler light curves indicates that our model predicts low binary probabilities at eclipsing phases (0, 0.5, and 1.0) as expected. The color-magnitude diagram also helps illustrate its feasibility and capability of identifying FGK MS binaries from spectra. We conclude that this model is reasonably reliable and can provide an automatic approach to identify SB2s with period \u227210 days.

Template-fitting and machine learning are the two main types of methods applied currently. Based on the training set obtained by cross-correlating the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR9 galaxy catalogue and the SDSS DR16 galaxy catalogue, the two kinds of methods are used and optimized, such as EAZY for template-fitting approach and CATBOOST for machine learning. Then, the created models are tested by the cross-matched samples of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR9 galaxy catalogue with LAMOST DR7, GAMA DR3, and WiggleZ galaxy catalogues. Moreover, three machine learning methods (CATBOOST, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Random Forest) are compared; CATBOOST shows its superiority for our case. By feature selection and optimization of model parameters, CATBOOST can obtain higher accuracy with optical and infrared photometric information, the best performance ($\\rm MSE=0.0032$, \u03c3<SUB>NMAD</SUB> = 0.0156, and $O=0.88{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$) with g \u2264 24.0, r \u2264 23.4, and z \u2264 22.5 is achieved.

      "abstract": "Context. With its origin coming from several sources (Big Bang, stars, cosmic rays) and given its strong depletion during its stellar lifetime, the lithium element is of great interest as its chemical evolution in the Milky Way is not well understood at present. To help constrain stellar and galactic chemical evolution models, numerous and precise lithium abundances are necessary for a large range of evolutionary stages, metallicities, and Galactic volume. <BR /> Aims: In the age of stellar parametrization on industrial scales, spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE, GALAH, RAVE, and LAMOST have used data-driven methods to rapidly and precisely infer stellar labels (atmospheric parameters and abundances). To prepare the ground for future spectroscopic surveys such as 4MOST and WEAVE, we aim to apply machine learning techniques to lithium measurements and analyses. <BR /> Methods: We trained a convolution neural network (CNN), coupling Gaia-ESO Survey iDR6 stellar labels (T<SUB>eff</SUB>, log(g), [Fe/H], and A(Li)) and GIRAFFE HR15N spectra, to infer the atmospheric parameters and lithium abundances for \u223c40 000 stars. The CNN architecture and accompanying notebooks are available online via GitHub. <BR /> Results: We show that the CNN properly learns the physics of the stellar labels, from relevant spectral features through a broad range of evolutionary stages and stellar parameters. The lithium feature at 6707.8 \u00c5 is successfully singled out by our CNN, among the thousands of lines in the GIRAFFE HR15N setup. Rare objects such as lithium-rich giants are found in our sample. This level of performance is achieved thanks to a meticulously built, high-quality, and homogeneous training sample. <BR /> Conclusions: The CNN approach is very well adapted for the next generations of spectroscopic surveys aimed at studying (among other elements) lithium, such as the 4MIDABLE-LR/HR (4MOST Milky Way disk and bulge low- and high-resolution) surveys. In this context, the caveats of machine-learning applications should be appropriately investigated, along with the realistic label uncertainties and upper limits for abundances. <P />Full Table 1 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr\">cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/671/A61\">https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/671/A61</A> <P />https://github.com/SamirNepal/LiCNN2022. <P />Based on observations collected with ESO telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory in Chile, for the Gaia-ESO Large Public Spectroscopic Survey (188.B-3002, 193.B-0936, 197.B-1074).",

The initial training of the network was performed on a labelled set of about 13 000 spectra obtained in the 400 \u00c5 wide region around H\u03b1 by the 2 m Perek telescope of the Ond\u0159ejov observatory, which mostly contains spectra of Be and related early-type stars. The differences between the Ond\u0159ejov intermediate-resolution and the LAMOST low-resolution spectrographs were compensated for by Gaussian blurring and wavelength conversion. <BR /> Results: After several iterations, the network was able to successfully identify emission-line stars with an error smaller than 6.5%. Using the technology of the Virtual Observatory to visualise the results, we discovered 1013 spectra of 948 new candidates of emission-line objects in addition to 664 spectra of 549 objects that are listed in SIMBAD and 2644 spectra of 2291 objects identified in an earlier paper of a Chinese group led by Wen Hou. The most interesting objects with unusual spectral properties are discussed in detail. <P />Catalogues of our emission-line candidates are are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/643/A122\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/643/A122</A> <P />Based on spectra obtained with 2 m Perek Telescope of Ond\u0159ejov observatory, Czech Republic and archival LAMOST DR2 spectra.",

Recent advancements in deep-learning techniques have enabled significant strides in identifying special objects within vast data sets. In this paper, we present a YSO identification method based on deep-learning principles and spectra from the LAMOST. We designed a structure based on a long short-term memory network and a convolutional neural network and trained different models in two steps to identify YSO candidates. Initially, we trained a model to detect stellar spectra featuring the H\u03b1 emission line, achieving an accuracy of 98.67%. Leveraging this model, we classified 10,495,781 stellar spectra from LAMOST, yielding 76,867 candidates displaying a H\u03b1 emission line. Subsequently, we developed a YSO identification model, which achieved a recall rate of 95.81% for YSOs. Utilizing this model, we further identified 35,021 YSO candidates from the H\u03b1 emission-line candidates. Following cross validation, 3204 samples were identified as previously reported YSO candidates. We eliminated samples with low signal-to-noise ratios and M dwarfs by using the equivalent widths of the N II and He I emission lines and visual inspection, resulting in a catalog of 20,530 YSO candidates. To facilitate future research endeavors, we provide the obtained catalogs of H\u03b1 emission-line star candidates and YSO candidates along with the code used for training the model.",

Amongst those sources, 393 DA stars and 46 DB stars are new identifications after cross-matching with the literature. In order to select DA candidates, we use the classification result from the LAMOST pipeline, colour-colour cut method and a random forest (RF) machine learning method. For DBs, since there is no template for DB in the pipeline model, a RF machine learning method is chosen to select candidates. All the WD candidates have been visually checked individually. The parameters of effective temperature, surface gravity, mass, and cooling age have been estimated for relatively high signal-to-noise ratio DAs and DBs. The peaks of the DA and DB mass distributions are found to be around 0.62 and 0.65 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, respectively. Finally, the data and method we used to select WD candidates for the second phase of LAMOST survey are also addressed in this paper.",

They can be treated as complementary to conventional methods, and we argue that some amount of human oversight is always needed and in fact highly beneficial when employing machine learning. We propose that a general dimensionality reduction technique can serve to diagnose and classify a given data set, and in case of GALAH spectra, our method quite effectively reveals a population of SB2 and SB3 systems. Once identified, the binary spectra can be analysed with the help of generative models, which can be constructed using machine learning techniques such as The Cannon and The Payne. Furthermore, in the case of spectroscopically unresolved multiple stars, we can recover the multiple contributions to an observed spectrum by reversing the process and proceeding from analysis to identification.",

Recent years have witnessed significant progress in using deep-learning methods for identifying unique objects in large-scale data. In this paper, we present a model based on transfer learning for identifying white dwarfs. We constructed a data set using the spectra released by LAMOST DR9 and trained a convolutional neural network model. The model was then further trained using a transfer-learning approach for a binary classification model. Our final model is comprised of a seven-class classification model and a binary classification model. The testing set yielded an accuracy rate of 96.08%. Our proposed model successfully identifies 4314 of the 4479 white dwarfs published in previous papers. We applied this model to filter the 1,121,128 spectral data from the LAMOST DR9 V1 catalog. Subsequently, we obtained 6317 white dwarf candidates, of which 5014 were cross-validated and found to be known white dwarfs. We finally identified 489 new white dwarfs out of the remaining 1303 candidates, containing 377 DAs, 1 DB, 4 DZs, 1 magnetic WD, 101 DA+M binaries, and 1 DB+M binary. Our study also compared transfer-learning methods with non-transfer-learning methods, and the results show that transfer learning provides faster training speed and a higher accuracy rate. We provide the trained model and a corresponding usage program for subsequent studies.",

After visually inspecting all of the spectra, we identify 323 CV candidates from the LAMOST database, among them 52 objects are new. We further classify the new CV candidates in subtypes based on their spectral features, including five DN subtypes during outbursts, five NL subtypes, and four magnetic CVs (three AM Her type and one IP type). We also find two CVs that have been previously identified by photometry and confirm their previous classification with the LAMOST spectra.",

In this study, we built a deep convolutional neural network (NN) to estimate basic stellar parameters $T\\rm {_{eff}}$, log g, metallicity ([M/H] and [Fe/H]) and [\u03b1/M] along with nine individual elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [N/Fe], [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Mn/Fe], and [Ni/Fe]). The NN is trained using common stars between the APOGEE survey and the LAMOST survey. We used low-resolution spectra from LAMOST survey as input, and measurements from APOGEE as labels. For stellar spectra with the signal-to-noise ratio in g band larger than 10 in the test set, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 29 K for $T\\rm {_{eff}}$, 0.07 dex for log g, 0.03 dex for both [Fe/H] and [M/H], and 0.02 dex for [\u03b1/M]. The MAE of most elements is between 0.02 and 0.04 dex. The trained NN was applied to 1210 145 giants, including sub-giants, from LAMOST DR8 within the range of stellar parameters 3500 K &lt; $T\\rm {_{eff}}$ &lt; 5500 K, 0.0 dex &lt; log g &lt; 4.0 dex, -2.5 dex &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0.5 dex. The distribution of our results in the chemical spaces is highly consistent with APOGEE labels and stellar parameters show consistency with external high-resolution measurements from GALAH.
