        "Strong relevance to the main paper's topic of dwarf AGN identification using emission-line diagnostics.",
        "Includes a paper (Result 1) that directly references the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, which are central to the main paper.",
        "Addresses the 'star-forming AGN' (SF-AGN) category, a key finding of the main paper.",
        "Covers alternative diagnostic diagrams beyond the traditional BPT diagram, which is a focus of the main paper (Results 1, 4).",
        "Explores the metallicity dependence of emission-line diagnostics, a critical aspect discussed in the main paper (Results 1, 2, 5)."

      "weaknesses": [
        "Some results (e.g., Results 2, 3, 6, 8, 9) focus on higher redshift galaxies or more general emission-line studies, which are less directly relevant to the main paper's focus on local dwarf AGN.",
        "The connection between gas dynamics (Result 5) and the specific AGN classification scheme in the main paper could be stronger."
      ],
      "summary": "Set 1 is highly relevant, with several results directly addressing the main paper's topic of dwarf AGN identification in the local universe using emission-line diagnostics and alternative classification schemes. While some results are broader, the core findings align well with the main paper's focus."

    "justification": "Set 1 stands out due to its direct relevance to the main paper's core themes. Result 1, titled \"Surprisingly Abundant Dwarf AGN in the RESOLVE and ECO z 0 AGN Census,\" explicitly mentions the same surveys (RESOLVE and ECO) used in the main paper and discusses the 'star-forming AGN' (SF-AGN) category, which is a novel finding of the main paper. This result also highlights the use of alternative diagnostic plots ([OI]/H\u03b1 or [SII]/H\u03b1), a key methodological aspect of the main paper that aims to overcome the limitations of the BPT diagram in low-metallicity environments. Result 4, \"Alternative diagnostic diagrams and the `forgotten' population of weak line galaxies in the SDSS,\" further reinforces the focus on alternative diagnostic diagrams and their application to emission-line galaxies. While other results in Set 1 are somewhat less directly relevant, the presence of these highly pertinent papers makes it the strongest set overall.",
