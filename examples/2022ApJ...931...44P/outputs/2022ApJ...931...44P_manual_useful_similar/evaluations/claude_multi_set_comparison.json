The first result in this set discusses the multiwavelength census of dwarf AGN candidates in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, which is the same dataset used in the main paper. It provides additional details and analysis on the specific methodology of using optimized emission-line diagnostics to identify 'star-forming AGN' (SF-AGN) in dwarf galaxies. The result also discusses the implications and significance of the findings, such as the higher dwarf AGN percentage compared to previous estimates and the properties of SF-AGN hosts. Overall, Set 1 is highly relevant and directly addresses the main paper's topic, methodology, and findings.",
