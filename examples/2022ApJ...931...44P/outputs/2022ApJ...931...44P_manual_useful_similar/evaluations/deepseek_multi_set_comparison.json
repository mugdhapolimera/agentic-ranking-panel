      "strengths": [
        "Includes papers on emission-line diagnostics (Results 2, 6, 10) directly relevant to the main paper's focus on optimizing classification schemes.",
        "Covers metallicity effects (Result 4) and photoionization modeling (Results 6, 9), aligning with the main paper's methodology.",
        "Discusses AGN classification (Results 3, 7, 10) and host galaxy properties (Results 3, 7), which contextualize the main paper's SF-AGN category.",
        "Uses SDSS data (Results 1, 3, 4, 7), matching the main paper's observational basis."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Limited focus on low-metallicity dwarfs; only Result 4 explicitly addresses metallicity in star-forming galaxies.",
        "No direct mention of the [S II]/H\u03b1 and [O I]/H\u03b1 diagnostics proposed in the main paper; existing diagnostics (e.g., BPT) are emphasized instead.",
        "Minimal coverage of the SF-AGN category or halo mass dependencies highlighted in the main paper.",
        "Some papers (e.g., Result 1, 5, 8) are tangential to the main paper's core focus."
      ],
      "summary": "Set 1 provides strong foundational coverage of emission-line diagnostics, AGN classification, and metallicity effects, but lacks specificity on the main paper's novel SF-AGN category and optimized low-metallicity diagnostics."

  "comparison": {
    "best_set": 1,
    "justification": "As only Set 1 is provided, it is inherently the best set. Its strengths include multiple papers on emission-line diagnostics (e.g., Results 2, 6, 10), which underpin the main paper's methodology, and discussions of metallicity (Result 4) and AGN host properties (Result 7). However, it lacks explicit coverage of the main paper's key innovations, such as the SF-AGN classification and the superiority of [S II]/H\u03b1 and [O I]/H\u03b1 diagrams for low-metallicity dwarfs.",

    "improvement_suggestions": [
      "Include papers specifically addressing AGN in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies and alternative diagnostics like [S II]/H\u03b1.",
      "Add studies on cosmic gas accretion in low-mass halos (<10^11.5 M\u2299) to contextualize the SF-AGN population.",
      "Incorporate recent work comparing spectral fitting methodologies, as the main paper highlights discrepancies in dwarf AGN percentages due to such differences."
