      "explanation": "This paper is highly relevant to the main paper as it investigates the use of emission-line intensity ratios for classifying extragalactic objects, including separating active galactic nuclei (AGN) from other types of objects. The methodology and goals align closely with the main paper's aim of optimizing emission-line diagnostics for identifying low-metallicity dwarf AGN candidates."
