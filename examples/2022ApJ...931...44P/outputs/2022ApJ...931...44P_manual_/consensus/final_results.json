To recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics.

        "abstract": "The finding of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies has important implications for galaxy evolution and supermassive black hole formation models. Yet, how AGNs in dwarf galaxies form is still debated, in part due to scant demographics. We use the MaNGA survey, comprising ~10 000 galaxies at z &lt; 0.15, to identify AGN dwarf galaxies using a spaxel-by-spaxel classification in three spatially-resolved emission-line diagnostic diagrams (the [N II]-, [S II]-, and [O I]-BPT) and the WHAN diagram. This yields a sample of 664 AGN dwarf galaxies, the largest to date, and an AGN fraction of $\\sim 20~{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$ that is significantly larger than that of single-fibre-spectroscopy studies (i.e. $\\sim 1~{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$). This can be explained by the lower bolometric luminosity (&lt;10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and accretion rate (sub-Eddington) of the MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies. We additionally identify 1176 SF-AGNs (classified as star-forming in the [N II]-BPT but as AGNs in the [S II]- and [O I]-BPT), 122 Composite, and 173 LINER sources. The offset between the optical centre of the galaxy and the median position of the AGN spaxels is more than 3 arcsec for ~62% of the AGNs, suggesting that some could be off-nuclear. We also identify seven new broad-line AGNs with log M<SUB>BH</SUB> = 5.0-5.9 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. Our results show how integral-field spectroscopy is a powerful tool for uncovering faint and low-accretion AGNs and better constraining the demographics of AGNs in dwarf galaxies.",

X-ray AGNs are selected from deep XMM observations using a new method that results in greater samples with a wider range of X-ray luminosities, complete to {log}({L}<SUB>{{X</SUB>}})&gt; 41 for z &lt; 0.3. Taking X-ray detectability into account, we find that the average fraction of X-ray AGNs in the BPT star-forming branch is 2%, suggesting the BPT diagram can provide a reasonably clean sample of star-forming galaxies. However, the X-ray selection is itself rather incomplete. At the tip of the AGN branch of the BPT diagram, the X-ray AGN fraction is only 14%, which may have implications for studies that exclude AGNs based only on X-ray observations. Interestingly, the X-ray AGN fractions are similar for Seyfert and LINER populations, consistent with LINERs being true AGNs. We find that neither the star formation dilution nor the hidden broad-line components can satisfactorily explain the apparent misclassification of X-ray AGNs. On the other hand, \u223c40% of all X-ray AGNs have weak emission lines such that they cannot be placed on the BPT diagram at all and often have low specific SFRs. Therefore, the most likely explanation for \u201cmisclassified\u201d X-ray AGNs is that they have intrinsically weak AGN lines, and are only placeable on the BPT diagram when they tend to have high specific SFRs.",

We selected the AGN using the classical BPT diagram, a similar optical emission line diagnostic based on the He II \u03bb4686 line, and mid-IR colour cuts. Different criteria select host galaxies with different physical properties such as stellar mass and optical colour and only 3 out of 336 sources fulfil all three criteria. This could be in part due to selection biases. The resulting AGN fraction of \u223c0.7 per cent is at least one order of magnitude below the one estimated for more massive galaxies. At optical wavelengths, the He II-based AGN selection appears to be more sensitive to AGN hosted in star-forming galaxies than the classical BPT diagram, at least in the low-mass regime. The archival X-ray and radio data available for some of the AGN candidates seem to confirm their AGN nature, but follow-up observations are needed to confirm the AGN nature of the rest of the sample, especially in the case of mid-IR selection. Our sample will be important for future follow-up studies aiming to understand the relation between BHs and host galaxies in the low-mass regime.",

Remarkably, 16 of 20 quiescent galaxies in our sample host central active galactic nucleus (AGN)-like line ratios. Only five of these quiescent galaxies were identified as AGN-like in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey due to a lower spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We find that many of the quiescent galaxies in our sample have spatially extended emission across the non-star-forming regions of BPT-space. While quenched galaxies in denser environments in this mass range often show no evidence for AGN activity, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies in isolation host AGNs despite their overall passive appearances.",

        "abstract": "Current emission-line-based estimates of the metallicity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at both high and low redshifts indicate that AGN have predominantly solar-to-supersolar metallicities. This leads to the question: do low-metallicity AGN exist? In this paper, we use photoionization models to examine the effects of metallicity variations on the narrow emission-lines from an AGN. We explore a variety of emission-line diagnostics that are useful for identifying AGN with low-metallicity gas. We find that line ratios involving [NII] are the most robust metallicity indicators in galaxies where the primary source of ionization is from the active nucleus. Ratios involving [SII] and [OI] are strongly affected by uncertainties in modelling the density structure of the narrow-line clouds. To test our diagnostics, we turn to an analysis of AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a clear trend in the relative strength of [NII] with the mass of the AGN-host galaxy. The metallicity of the ISM is known to be correlated with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies; our results indicate that a similar trend exists for AGN. We also find that the best-fitting models for typical Seyfert narrow-line regions (NLRs) have supersolar abundances. Although there is a mass-dependent range of a factor of 2-3 in the NLR metallicities of the AGN in our sample, AGN with subsolar metallicities are very rare in the SDSS. Out of a sample of ~23000 Seyfert 2 galaxies, we find only ~40 clear candidates for AGN with NLR abundances that are below solar.",

These models span a wide range of physical parameters including metallicity, ionization parameter, and the adoption of both an instantaneous burst and continuous star formation history (SFH). We examine the agreement between our models and local (z &lt; 0.1) star-forming galaxy populations from several large data sets, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey, and samples of blue compact galaxies and metal-poor galaxies. We find that models adopting a continuous SFH reproduce the metallicity-sensitive line ratios observed in the local population of star-forming galaxies, including the low-metallicity sample. However, we find that the current codes generate an insufficiently hard ionizing radiation field, leading to deficiencies in the [S II] fluxes produced by the models.

We find tentative evidence for steeper far-UV spectral slopes in lower-mass systems. Overall, NLR emission lines in these low-mass AGNs exhibit trends similar to those seen in AGNs with higher-mass BHs, such as increasing blueshifts and broadening with increasing ionization potential. Additionally, we see evidence of an intermediate-line region whose intensity correlates with L/L <SUB>Edd</SUB>, as seen in higher-mass AGNs. We highlight the interesting trend that, at least in these low-mass AGNs, the [O III] equivalent width (EW) is highest in symmetric NLR lines with no blue wing.

        "abstract": "We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 \u00d7 10<SUP>5</SUP> and 2 \u00d7 10<SUP>10</SUP> yr at a resolution of 3 \u00c5 across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 \u00c5 for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 \u00c5 to 160 \u03bcm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.",

We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]\u03bb5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong H\u03b4 absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.",

        "abstract": "We utilize Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging and spectroscopy of ~53,000 star-forming galaxies at z~0.1 to study the relation between stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity. We derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar masses using new techniques that make use of the latest stellar evolutionary synthesis and photoionization models. We find a tight (+/-0.1 dex) correlation between stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity. The relation is relatively steep from 10<SUP>8.5</SUP> to 10<SUP>10.5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> h<SUP>-2</SUP><SUB>70</SUB>, in good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 10<SUP>10.5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. We use indirect estimates of the gas mass based on the H\u03b1 luminosity to compare our data to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. We show that metal loss is strongly anticorrelated with baryonic mass, with low-mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal depleted than L<SUP>*</SUP> galaxies at z~0.1. Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies but is found in galaxies with masses as high as 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. We interpret this as strong evidence of both the ubiquity of galactic winds and their effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells.",

        "abstract": "We construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry and ground-based kinematics. The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M_\u2022. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M_\u2022 and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon ~ L^0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95% confidence level an MDO of mass M_\u2022 ~ 0.006M_bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M_\u2022 = 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M_\u2022. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f ~= 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M_\u2022/M_bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation ~0.51. There is also marginal evidence that M_\u2022 is distributed differently for ``core'' and ``power law'' galaxies, with core galaxies having a somewhat steeper dependence on M_bulge.",

        "title": "Theoretical Modeling of Starburst Galaxies",
        "abstract": "We have modeled a large sample of infrared starburst galaxies using both the PEGASE v2.0 and STARBURST99 codes to generate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the young star clusters. PEGASE utilizes the Padova group tracks, while STARBURST99 uses the Geneva group tracks, allowing comparison between the two. We used our MAPPINGS III code to compute photoionization models that include a self-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We use the standard optical diagnostic diagrams as indicators of the hardness of the EUV radiation field in these galaxies. These diagnostic diagrams are most sensitive to the spectral index of the ionizing radiation field in the 1-4 ryd region. We find that warm infrared starburst galaxies contain a relatively hard EUV field in this region. The PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in the 1-4 ryd range than that of STARBURST99. As the spectrum in this regime is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, this discrepancy is most likely due to the differences in stellar atmosphere models used for the W-R stars. The PEGASE models use the Clegg &amp; Middlemass planetary nebula nuclei (PNN) atmosphere models for the W-R stars, whereas the STARBURST99 models use the Schmutz, Leitherer, &amp; Gruenwald W-R atmosphere models. We believe that the Schmutz et al. atmospheres are more applicable to the starburst galaxies in our sample; however, they do not produce the hard EUV field in the 1-4 ryd region required by our observations. The inclusion of continuum metal blanketing in the models may be one solution. Supernova remnant (SNR) shock modeling shows that the contribution by mechanical energy from SNRs to the photoionization models is &lt;&lt;20%. The models presented here are used to derive a new theoretical classification scheme for starbursts and active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies based on the optical diagnostic diagrams.",

We show that Seyferts and low-ionization narrow emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus-HII (AGN-HII) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [OIII] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [OIII] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[OIII]/\u03c3<SUP>4</SUP>, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixed L[OIII]/\u03c3<SUP>4</SUP>, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/L<SUB>EDD</SUB> and Seyferts dominant at high L/L<SUB>EDD</SUB>. These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than required by Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.",
