        "justification": "The first set of results is significantly more relevant and focused on the main paper's research questions and methodology of using optimized emission line diagnostics to detect low-metallicity dwarf AGN candidates. It contains several highly relevant papers that directly align with the goals outlined in the main paper, including papers that present new samples of dwarf AGN candidates identified through emission line analysis. The results are well-ordered, with the most pertinent papers concentrated towards the top of the list. In contrast, the second set covers topics that provide useful background information but have less direct relevance to the core research focus of the main paper. The results are also less ideally ordered by relevance, with some of the most relevant papers scattered towards the middle and bottom. While the second set offers valuable context, the first set is clearly superior in addressing the specific research aims of using optimized emission line diagnostics to uncover dwarf AGN candidates across a range of metallicities."
