Key papers (1,3,8,9,10,12) directly address the main paper's methodology and research questions. The second set, while containing foundational work on emission-line diagnostics (Results 2,6,10), lacks specificity to dwarfs and low-metallicity AGN, with many tangential results. The first set's ranking is stronger, placing highly relevant papers (e.g., MAD, Crossing the Line, metallicity diagnostics) near the top, while the second set's ordering is less focused."
