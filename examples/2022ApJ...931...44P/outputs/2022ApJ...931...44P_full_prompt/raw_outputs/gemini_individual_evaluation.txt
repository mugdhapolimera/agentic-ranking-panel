            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "This result is highly relevant. It directly addresses the main paper's focus on finding low-metallicity dwarf AGN candidates using a modified emission line classification scheme. It specifically mentions the use of BPT, [SII]/H-alpha, and [OI]/H-alpha plots, mirroring the diagnostic tools discussed in the main paper. The inclusion of 'SF-AGN' and the application to the RESOLVE survey further solidifies its close alignment with the original research."
        },
        "2": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "This result is also highly relevant. It directly compares different methods for finding z~0 dwarf AGN using the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, which is central to the main paper. The mention of comprehensive emission-line classification using BPT, [S II]/Ha, and [O I]/Ha, a redefined BPT demarcation, and mid-IR color selection demonstrates a strong connection to the main paper's methodology. The inclusion of the 'SF-AGN' category further aligns this result with the original research."
        },
        "3": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "This result is highly relevant. It provides a multiwavelength census of dwarf AGN in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, utilizing mid-IR colors and BPT diagrams (both traditional and alternative). The most important aspect is the explicit mention of the 'star-forming AGN' (SF-AGN) category and the use of [OI]/Hα or [SII]/Hα in diagnostic plots, directly referencing and building upon the methodology presented in the main paper. The analysis of photoionization models to confirm line ratio patterns is also relevant."
        },
        "4": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "This result is highly relevant. It directly addresses the main paper's topic by investigating AGN in dwarf galaxies and employing a multi-diagnostic classification system. It mentions the use of the RESOLVE and ECO surveys and the discovery of Star Forming-AGN (SF-AGN), aligning perfectly with the main paper's research goals and methodology. The discussion of optical emission line diagnostics and mid-IR color-selection further strengthens its relevance."
        },
        "5": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "This result is relevant, though slightly less direct than the previous ones. It applies a Bayesian classification scheme to predict AGN vs. Star Formation emission in RESOLVE and ECO galaxies, which is related to the main paper's goal of identifying AGN. While it doesn't explicitly focus on the same diagnostic plots ([SII]/Hα, [OI]/Hα), it uses optical spectroscopy and addresses the issue of ambiguous classifications, a problem the main paper seeks to resolve. The mention of low metallicity dwarfs makes it more relevant."
        },
        "6": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "This result is relevant. It focuses on detecting low-metallicity AGN in the RESOLVE survey, aligning with the main paper's objective. It mentions the BPT method and the issue of low-metallicity AGN not separating from star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram. While it focuses on emission-line profile fitting rather than the specific diagnostic plots highlighted in the main paper, it still addresses a core problem tackled by the original research."
        },
        "7": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "This result is relevant. It examines the effects of metallicity variations on emission lines from AGN and explores emission-line diagnostics for identifying low-metallicity AGN. While it doesn't directly reference the RESOLVE/ECO surveys or the SF-AGN category, it touches on the core issue of low-metallicity AGN identification and the limitations of current emission-line-based methods. The discussion of [NII], [SII], and [OI] line ratios is also relevant."
        },
        "8": {
            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant but more tangential. It introduces a new method for identifying AGN based on emission-line excess and compares it to the BPT method. While it touches on AGN identification, it doesn't focus on dwarf galaxies, low-metallicity AGN, or the specific diagnostic plots used in the main paper. The focus is more on the method itself rather than the specific research question addressed in the main paper."
        },
        "9": {
            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant. It explores the environments of dwarf galaxies with optical AGN characteristics, which is related to the broader context of AGN in dwarf galaxies. However, it doesn't directly address the main paper's methodology of using specific emission-line diagnostics to identify low-metallicity AGN. The focus is on environmental factors rather than the identification methods themselves."
        },
        "10": {
            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant. It reports the discovery of low-metallicity dwarf galaxies with broad line emission, suggesting the presence of AGN. However, it doesn't focus on the specific emission-line diagnostic plots or classification schemes used in the main paper. The emphasis is on the broad line emission and the properties of the discovered galaxies, rather than the methodological challenges of identifying low-metallicity AGN."
