            "1": {"score": 3, "explanation": "Directly aligns with the main paper's methodology, using spatially-resolved [S II]/[O I] diagnostics to identify dwarf AGN and SF-AGN. Reports a high AGN fraction (20%), supporting the main paper's conclusions."},
            "2": {"score": 2, "explanation": "Relevant due to focus on dwarf AGN via BPT and fiber-size limitations, but less emphasis on metallicity effects or optimized diagnostics."},
            "3": {"score": 2, "explanation": "Addresses BPT misclassification (key to the main paper's problem) but focuses on X-ray AGN rather than metallicity-driven diagnostics."},

It contains multiple papers (Results 1, 6, 8, 9) that directly address the main paper's focus on low-metallicity dwarf AGN identification using optimized emission-line diagnostics ([S II]/[O I] vs BPT). These results validate the main paper's methodology, discuss SF-AGN, and explore metallicity effects. The second set includes foundational work on emission-line classification (Results 2, 6, 10) but lacks the same depth on dwarf AGN, metallicity, or diagnostic optimization. The first set's ordering prioritizes highly relevant studies, while the second set's top results are less focused on the specific research questions."
