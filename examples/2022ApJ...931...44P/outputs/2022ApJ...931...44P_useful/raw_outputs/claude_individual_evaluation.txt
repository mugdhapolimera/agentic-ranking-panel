        "1": {"score": 2, "explanation": "The result discusses stellar population synthesis models, which are relevant to the main paper's topic of emission line diagnostics for galaxies. However, it does not directly address the specific issue of identifying AGN in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies."},
        "2": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it directly discusses the use of emission line ratios for classifying extragalactic objects, including AGN and star-forming galaxies. The methodology of using diagnostic diagrams is closely aligned with the main paper's approach."},
        "3": {"score": 2, "explanation": "While this result examines the properties of AGN host galaxies, it does not specifically focus on low-metallicity dwarf galaxies or the use of optimized emission line diagnostics, which are central to the main paper."},
        "4": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result investigates the mass-metallicity relation in star-forming galaxies, which is relevant to the main paper's discussion of low-metallicity dwarfs. However, it does not directly address the issue of identifying AGN in these galaxies."},
        "5": {"score": 1, "explanation": "This result is focused on the demographics of massive dark objects in galaxy centers, which is tangential to the main paper's topic of emission line diagnostics for identifying AGN in dwarf galaxies."},
        "6": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result discusses the modeling of starburst galaxies using emission line diagnostics, which is relevant to the main paper's methodology. However, it does not specifically address the issue of identifying AGN in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies."},
        "7": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it presents a new classification scheme for separating AGN, star-forming galaxies, and other emission-line objects using diagnostic diagrams. The methodology and goals are closely aligned with the main paper."},
        "8": {"score": 2, "explanation": "While this result discusses the search for intermediate-mass black holes, which is related to the topic of AGN, it does not directly address the use of emission line diagnostics or the specific issue of identifying AGN in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies."},
        "9": {"score": 1, "explanation": "This result describes updates to the Cloudy spectral synthesis code, which is tangential to the main paper's focus on emission line diagnostics for identifying AGN in dwarf galaxies."},
        "10": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it proposes a revised method for classifying emission-line galaxies, including AGN and star-forming galaxies, based on emission line ratios. The methodology and goals are closely aligned with the main paper."}
