        "justification": "The second set of results is much more relevant and focused on the main paper's specific research topic of finding and classifying low-metallicity dwarf AGN candidates using optimized emission-line diagnostics. Many of the papers directly address the methodology proposed in the main paper, apply it to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, or present complementary approaches to the same goal. In contrast, the first set contains mostly tangentially relevant papers on topics like stellar population modeling, AGN host properties, and general emission-line classification schemes. While some of those papers provide useful background, very few directly match the main paper's novel focus on low-metallicity dwarf AGN. Additionally, the second set is exceptionally well-ordered, with the most relevant papers appearing first, while the first set has relevant papers scattered throughout. Overall, the second set is a much better match for addressing the main paper's research questions and presenting its core methodology."
