Several results in this set perfectly match the main paper's topic and methodology, including the use of the same surveys (RESOLVE and ECO) and the application of the proposed multi-diagnostic classification scheme. The results are also well-ordered by relevance, with the most directly relevant results appearing first. In contrast, while the first set contains some relevant results related to emission-line diagnostics and active galactic nuclei, few results specifically address low-metallicity dwarf galaxies or the proposed methodology. The second set clearly provides more high-quality and directly relevant results to the main paper's research questions and methodology."
