All results except 8 and 9 directly address the main paper’s focus on low-metallicity dwarf AGN, using RESOLVE/ECO data and multi-diagnostic methods. Results are perfectly ordered, with the most relevant (SF-AGN, multi-method comparisons) at the top. The first set includes tangential topics (stellar populations, code updates) and has weaker relevance to dwarfs. The second set’s methodology, surveys, and findings align seamlessly with the main paper, making it a much better match."
