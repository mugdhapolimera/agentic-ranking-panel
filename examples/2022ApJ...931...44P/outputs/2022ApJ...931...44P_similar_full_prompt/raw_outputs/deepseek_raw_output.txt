All results (1â€“7, 10) directly address the main paper's focus on low-metallicity dwarf AGN identification using multi-diagnostic methods, RESOLVE/ECO surveys, and SF-AGN. The first set has scattered relevance, with only a few results (7, 8, 10) partially aligning. The second set's results are perfectly ordered, starting with identical methodologies and progressing to supporting studies, while the first set buries key results (e.g., Result 7, 8, 10) among tangential ones."
