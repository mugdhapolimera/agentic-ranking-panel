It includes multiple results (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) that directly address the main paper's focus on RESOLVE/ECO surveys, SF-AGN classification, and optimized emission-line diagnostics for low-metallicity dwarfs. These results replicate the main paper's methodology and expand on its findings. The first set has only one highly relevant result (Result 1) and several tangential studies. The second set's ordering prioritizes RESOLVE/ECO-specific analyses, ensuring the most relevant results appear early. The first set's ranking is weaker, with high-z or non-dwarf studies diluting relevance."
