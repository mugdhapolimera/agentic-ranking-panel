        "abstract": "We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 \u00d7 10<SUP>5</SUP> and 2 \u00d7 10<SUP>10</SUP> yr at a resolution of 3 \u00c5 across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 \u00c5 for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 \u00c5 to 160 \u03bcm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.",

We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]\u03bb5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong H\u03b4 absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.",

We derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar masses using new techniques that make use of the latest stellar evolutionary synthesis and photoionization models. We find a tight (+/-0.1 dex) correlation between stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity.

        "abstract": "We construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry and ground-based kinematics. The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M_\u2022. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M_\u2022 and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon ~ L^0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95% confidence level an MDO of mass M_\u2022 ~ 0.006M_bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M_\u2022 = 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M_\u2022. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f ~= 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M_\u2022/M_bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation ~0.51. There is also marginal evidence that M_\u2022 is distributed differently for ``core'' and ``power law'' galaxies, with core galaxies having a somewhat steeper dependence on M_bulge.",

        "abstract": "We have modeled a large sample of infrared starburst galaxies using both the PEGASE v2.0 and STARBURST99 codes to generate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the young star clusters. PEGASE utilizes the Padova group tracks, while STARBURST99 uses the Geneva group tracks, allowing comparison between the two. We used our MAPPINGS III code to compute photoionization models that include a self-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We use the standard optical diagnostic diagrams as indicators of the hardness of the EUV radiation field in these galaxies. These diagnostic diagrams are most sensitive to the spectral index of the ionizing radiation field in the 1-4 ryd region. We find that warm infrared starburst galaxies contain a relatively hard EUV field in this region. The PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in the 1-4 ryd range than that of STARBURST99. As the spectrum in this regime is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, this discrepancy is most likely due to the differences in stellar atmosphere models used for the W-R stars. The PEGASE models use the Clegg &amp; Middlemass planetary nebula nuclei (PNN) atmosphere models for the W-R stars, whereas the STARBURST99 models use the Schmutz, Leitherer, &amp; Gruenwald W-R atmosphere models. We believe that the Schmutz et al. atmospheres are more applicable to the starburst galaxies in our sample; however, they do not produce the hard EUV field in the 1-4 ryd region required by our observations. The inclusion of continuum metal blanketing in the models may be one solution. Supernova remnant (SNR) shock modeling shows that the contribution by mechanical energy from SNRs to the photoionization models is &lt;&lt;20%. The models presented here are used to derive a new theoretical classification scheme for starbursts and active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies based on the optical diagnostic diagrams.",

We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus-HII (AGN-HII) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [OIII] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [OIII] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[OIII]/\u03c3<SUP>4</SUP>, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixed L[OIII]/\u03c3<SUP>4</SUP>, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear.

This scheme uses a combination of the [NII]/H-alpha (BPT), [SII]/H-alpha, and [OI]/H-alpha emission line diagnostic plots. SF-AGN is a new category of AGN candidates that were previously classified inconsistently among the three diagnostics. Our new scheme aims to identify undetected AGN candidates among dwarf galaxies, determining a better lower limit for the z~0 massive black hole occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies. We use photoionization models to show that the [SII] and [OI] line diagnostics identify AGN in low metallicity dwarf galaxies that are missed by the BPT diagnostic, providing theoretical motivation for using our new scheme. We apply this scheme to galaxies in the z~0 RESOLVE survey, a statistically complete volume-limited census dominated by dwarfs (stellar mass &lt; 10<SUP>9.5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>). For initial classification, we use SDSS MPA-JHU line measurements with S/N &gt; 5 for all relevant emission lines. This S/N cut limits the ~1500 galaxy RESOLVE survey to a sample of 462 galaxies, of which 306 are dwarfs. Including SF-AGN, we find that 5.2% of dwarfs are AGN candidates, compared to 0.3% using the traditional AGN/composite classifications alone. The SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs having moderately high long-term star formation, but not necessarily recent starburst activity. We seek external confirmation of these results by comparisons to archival X-ray, mid-IR, and radio data. We also examine spatially resolved spectroscopy available from the RESOLVE and SAMI surveys for a subset of the candidates to check that AGN signatures appear only near the center of the galaxy.

In this study, we compare the statistics and properties of z~0 dwarf AGN in the volume- and mass-limited RESOLVE and ECO surveys found by three methods: (1) comprehensive optical emission-line classification simultaneously using the [O III]/Hb vs. [N II]/Ha (BPT plot), [S II]/Ha, and [O I]/Ha diagnostic plots, (2) a redefined demarcation line for the BPT plot, and (3) mid-IR colour selection.

Each of the three methods identifies AGN in ~1-2% of dwarfs in the full galaxy population. AGN hosts identified by the comprehensive classification method vs. by mid-IR colours appear similar \u2014 mostly dwarfs with high star formation activity, high gas content, and low metallicity \u2014 but there is virtually no overlap in the identified objects. Relatively few AGN hosts identified by the redefined BPT plot are dwarfs, and these few dwarfs differ from those identified by the comprehensive classification method or mid-IR colours in having modest star formation activity, low gas content, and high metallicity.

Emission line flux ratios of SF-AGN position them as star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram but as AGN in at least one of two other diagnostic plots using [OI]/H\u03b1 or [SII]/H\u03b1 instead of the metallicity-sensitive [NII]/H\u03b1 used in the BPT diagram. SF-AGN are common in local dwarf galaxies, and photoionization models confirm their line ratio patterns match those of model low-metallicity, highly star-forming dwarf galaxies with active intermediate-mass black holes. Given the statistically complete nature of these surveys down to baryonic (stellar+gas) masses of ~10<SUP>9.2</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, they give us the opportunity to quote full-population AGN statistics previously unavailable in the dwarf regime. The addition of SF-AGN and bonus AGN from the alternative BPT plot quadruples the optical dwarf AGN percentage from ~1% to ~4% of the full galaxy population (including non-emission line galaxies). Mid-IR colours also identify up to ~4% of all dwarfs as AGN, albeit the status of the mid-IR AGN candidates is less secure than the optical AGN. We find little overlap between methods, hinting at the possibility that they identify AGN hosts at different evolutionary stages. The bonus dwarf AGN from the alternative BPT method mostly have relatively high metallicity and low star formation activity for dwarfs. In contrast, the mid-IR and SF-AGN hosts have more typical metallicities and star formation rates. Assuming all AGN candidates to be valid, the combined multiwavelength z~0 dwarf AGN frequency is ~5-8%, implying that active accretion onto intermediate mass BHs in dwarf galaxies may be more widespread than previously realised, with implications for BH-galaxy coevolution.

        "title": "Investigating Active Galactic Nuclei in Dwarf and Giant Galaxies in the Nearby Universe",
        "abstract": "Understanding the occurrence and properties of actively accreting black holes, known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), is crucial for unraveling the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies across different mass scales. However, existing classification systems for identifying AGN based on optical emission-line diagnostics are primarily optimized for giant galaxies with stellar masses, M\u2217 &gt; 109.5 M\u2299. This poses a significant challenge in detecting AGN in low-metallicity and highly star-forming galaxies, particularly typical z\u223c0 dwarfs. In this work, we uncover AGN in dwarfs that have strong emission lines using a multi-diagnostic classification system that optimizes the use of existing optical diagnostics. Our multi-diagnostic system is more robust and systematic, providing a consistent categorization of galaxies that lack unique classifications. This systematic approach enables the identification of a hidden population of AGN candidates, referred to as Star Forming-AGN (SF-AGN), in metal-poor, gas-rich, star-forming dwarfs at z\u223c0. We apply this system to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys and discover that the percentage of optical AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines ranges from \u223c3-15%, which significantly exceeds previous estimates of \u223c1%.To investigate the frequency of actively accreting black holes in the nearby Universe, we compile a comprehensive inventory of AGN in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, using optical emission line diagnostics, including our multi-diagnostic approach for identifying SF-AGN, and mid-IR color-selection using WISE colors. The statistical completeness of the RESOLVE and ECO surveys allows us to calculate accurate AGN occupation fractions, representing the number of AGN relative to the total number of galaxies within the survey volume, including those that did not meet the criteria for any AGN search sample. Among the entire galaxy population, the percentage of optical and mid-IR AGN in dwarfs is approximately \u223c3-5%, whereas in giants it ranges from \u223c20-33%. Notably, the dwarf AGN percentage is at least double the previous estimates, while the AGN occurrence in giants is consistent with earlier studies. A key finding of this research is that AGN hosted by typical z\u223c0 dwarfs are predominantly classified as SF-AGN or WISE AGN.Subsequently, we extend the optical multi-diagnostic AGN classification system to a large archival dataset based on the SDSS footprint, encompassing 10\u00d7 the number of galaxies. Similar to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, we observe that over half of the dwarf AGN in the archival sample fall into the newly identified SFAGN category. Leveraging the statistical power of this archival dataset, we investigate the relationship between galaxy compactness and AGN activity as a function of mass. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between compactness and AGN percentage in a mass regime where galaxies are transitioning between dwarfs and giants.",

        "abstract": "We apply a Bayesian classification scheme using all available optical spectroscopy to predict the percentage of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) vs. Star Formation emission in galaxies from the RESOLVE and ECO surveys. Diagnostic plot classification using BPT diagrams with Strong Emission Lines (SELs) leaves some galaxies ambiguously classified as AGN or Star Forming, suggesting the potential importance of mixed cases. Furthermore, the recently introduced diagnostic plot of [HeII/H-beta] vs. [NII/H-alpha] reveals additional AGN that are missed by a binary BPT classification. These observations motivate the need to use all available spectroscopic information simultaneously in a single Bayesian modeling framework. We also use new grids that self-consistently model different mixing fractions of AGN + Star Formation emission, correctly treating the combined radiation field, unlike older grids that have linearly combined pure AGN and pure Star Forming models to approximate mixed cases. This Bayesian classification gives insight into emission processes for galaxies that are ambiguously and inconsistently classified using traditional diagnostic plots by providing a single multi-dimensional posterior distribution for the AGN - Star Formation mixing fraction based on all available lines. We find that this approach is especially important for the low metallicity dwarfs that dominate our volume-limited local universe surveys.",

        "title": "Toward Detection of Low-Metallicity AGN in the RESOLVE Survey",
        "abstract": "AGN are frequently identified using the BPT method in which quasars,Seyferts, and LINERS are clearly separated from star forming galaxies. However, recent modeling suggests that low-metallicity AGN do not separate from star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram, potentially resulting in unidentified AGN. We present initial results of our efforts to identify low-metallicity AGN in the RESOLVE survey using emission-line profile fitting to search for extended line wings indicative of possible AGN activity. The RESOLVE survey is an excellent test bed as a low-redshift, volume-limited survey dominated by dwarf galaxies. Our ultimate goal is to measure the relative frequency of heretofore undetected AGN and estimate their impact on star formation feedback, chemical evolution of galaxies, and the re-ionization of the universe at earlier times.

        "title": "Emission-line diagnostics of low-metallicity active galactic nuclei",
        "abstract": "Current emission-line-based estimates of the metallicity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at both high and low redshifts indicate that AGN have predominantly solar-to-supersolar metallicities. This leads to the question: do low-metallicity AGN exist? In this paper, we use photoionization models to examine the effects of metallicity variations on the narrow emission-lines from an AGN. We explore a variety of emission-line diagnostics that are useful for identifying AGN with low-metallicity gas. We find that line ratios involving [NII] are the most robust metallicity indicators in galaxies where the primary source of ionization is from the active nucleus. Ratios involving [SII] and [OI] are strongly affected by uncertainties in modelling the density structure of the narrow-line clouds. To test our diagnostics, we turn to an analysis of AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a clear trend in the relative strength of [NII] with the mass of the AGN-host galaxy. The metallicity of the ISM is known to be correlated with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies; our results indicate that a similar trend exists for AGN. We also find that the best-fitting models for typical Seyfert narrow-line regions (NLRs) have supersolar abundances. Although there is a mass-dependent range of a factor of 2-3 in the NLR metallicities of the AGN in our sample, AGN with subsolar metallicities are very rare in the SDSS. Out of a sample of ~23000 Seyfert 2 galaxies, we find only ~40 clear candidates for AGN with NLR abundances that are below solar.",

        "title": "A Method of Identifying AGNs Based on Emission-Line Excess and the Nature of Low-Luminosity AGNs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. I. A New Method",
        "abstract": "We developed a new technique for identifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and studied the nature of low-luminosity AGNs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This is the former part of a series of papers. We develop a new, sensitive method of identifying AGNs in this paper. The emission-line luminosity in a spectrum is the sum of a star-formation component and an AGN component (if present). We demonstrate that an accurate estimate of the star-formation component can be achieved by fitting model spectra, generated with a recent stellar population synthesis code, to a continuum spectrum. By comparing the observed total line luminosity with that attributed to star formation, we can tell whether a galaxy hosts an AGN or not. We compare our method with the commonly used emission-line diagnostics proposed by Baldwin, Phillips, and Terlevich (1981, PASP, 93, 5; hereafter BPT). By this method, we classify 85% of the strong emission-line objects in the same star-formation/AGN as BPT. One unique feature of our method is its sensitivity; it is applicable to nearly twice as many objects as BPT. We further make a comparison between our method and the BPT diagnostics using stacked spectra and selections in X-ray and radio wavelengths. We show that it is overall a sensitive method of identifying AGNs, while our method suffers from incompleteness and contamination as any AGN identification method does so. We emphasize that our method can be applied at high redshifts (up to Z \u223c 1.7 with red-sensitive optical spectrograph) without making any a priori assumptions about the host-galaxy properties. Another unique feature is that it allows us to subtract the emission-line luminosity due to star formation, and to extract the intrinsic AGN luminosity.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to explore the relation between dwarf galaxies (M<SUB>*</SUB> \u2264 5 \u00d7 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) with active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their environment by comparing neighbourhood parameters of AGN and non-AGN samples. Using the NASA-Sloan Atlas, both the local environment and the immediate environment of dwarf galaxies with z \u2264 0.055 are analysed. Of the 145 155 galaxies in the catalogue, 62 258 of them are classified as dwarf galaxies, and by employing two AGN selection methods based on emission-line fluxes (BPT and WHAN), 4476 are found to have AGN characteristics in their optical spectra. Regardless of selection method, this study finds no discernible differences in environment between AGN and non-AGN host dwarf galaxies and these results indicate that environment is not an important factor in triggering AGN activity in dwarf galaxies. This is in line with existing literature on environments of regular galaxies with AGNs and suggests universality in terms of reaction to environment across the mass regime. The biases of AGN selection in low-mass galaxies, and the biases of different measures of environment are also considered. It is found that there are several mass trends in emission-line ratios and that the SDSS fibre covers galaxies non-uniformly with redshift. These biases should be accounted for in future work by possibly including other wavelength regimes or mass weighting of emission-line ratios. Lastly, a discussion of the environment estimation methods is included since they may not gauge the desired properties due to factors such as time delay or using loosely constrained proxy parameters.",

        "title": "Broad line emission in dwarf galaxies: the first detection of low-metallicity AGN",
        "abstract": "Observations of AGN show that they generally possess a high metallicity, varying from solar to supersolar metallicities. This is the case since AGN are usually found in massive, bulge-dominated galaxies that have converted most of their gas into stars by the present epoch. Since AGN metallicity is strongly correlated with stellar mass, low-metallicity AGN are expected to be in low-mass dwarf galaxies. However, until now, searches in low-mass galaxies have only turned up AGN with metallicities around half that of typical AGN, i.e. with solar or slightly subsolar values. We report the discovery of four low-metallicity dwarf galaxies in the Data Release 6 of the Sloan Digital Sky survey, with 12 + log O/H in the range 7.4-8.0, and that appear to harbor an AGN. In the course of a long-range program to search for extremely metal-deficient emission-line dwarf galaxies, we have come across four galaxies with very unusual spectra: the strong permitted emission lines, mainly the H\u03b1 line, show very prominent broad components, with full widths at zero intensity corresponding to velocities varying between 2200 and 3500 km s<SUP>\u22121</SUP>, and extraordinarily large broad H\u03b1 luminosities, varying from 3\u00d710<SUP>41</SUP> to 2\u00d710<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>\u22121</SUP>. The Balmer lines show a very steep decrement, suggesting collisional excitation and that the broad emission comes from very dense gas (N<SUB>e</SUB> \u226b 10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>\u22123</SUP>). Only the presence of an accretion disk around an intermediate-mass black hole in the dwarf galaxies appears to account for these properties.",
