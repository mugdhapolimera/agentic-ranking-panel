        "abstract": "We provide a multiwavelength census of dwarf Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the volume- and mass-limited RESOLVE and ECO surveys using mid-IR colours, the BPT diagnostic plot with both traditional and alternative demarcations from literature, and our new multi-diagnostic approach revealing the previously overlooked \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN). Emission line flux ratios of SF-AGN position them as star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram but as AGN in at least one of two other diagnostic plots using [OI]/H\u03b1 or [SII]/H\u03b1 instead of the metallicity-sensitive [NII]/H\u03b1 used in the BPT diagram. SF-AGN are common in local dwarf galaxies, and photoionization models confirm their line ratio patterns match those of model low-metallicity, highly star-forming dwarf galaxies with active intermediate-mass black holes. Given the statistically complete nature of these surveys down to baryonic (stellar+gas) masses of ~10<SUP>9.2</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, they give us the opportunity to quote full-population AGN statistics previously unavailable in the dwarf regime. The addition of SF-AGN and bonus AGN from the alternative BPT plot quadruples the optical dwarf AGN percentage from ~1% to ~4% of the full galaxy population (including non-emission line galaxies). Mid-IR colours also identify up to ~4% of all dwarfs as AGN, albeit the status of the mid-IR AGN candidates is less secure than the optical AGN. We find little overlap between methods, hinting at the possibility that they identify AGN hosts at different evolutionary stages. The bonus dwarf AGN from the alternative BPT method mostly have relatively high metallicity and low star formation activity for dwarfs. In contrast, the mid-IR and SF-AGN hosts have more typical metallicities and star formation rates. Assuming all AGN candidates to be valid, the combined multiwavelength z~0 dwarf AGN frequency is ~5-8%, implying that active accretion onto intermediate mass BHs in dwarf galaxies may be more widespread than previously realised, with implications for BH-galaxy coevolution. We further investigate the properties and environments of SF-AGN and their hosts.",

        "abstract": "We use the chemical evolution predictions of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with our latest theoretical stellar population synthesis, photoionization, and shock models to predict the strong line evolution of ensembles of galaxies from z = 3 to the present day. In this paper, we focus on the brightest optical emission-line ratios, [N II]/H\u03b1 and [O III]/H\u03b2. We use the optical diagnostic Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram as a tool for investigating the spectral properties of ensembles of active galaxies. We use four redshift windows chosen to exploit new near-infrared multi-object spectrographs. We predict how the BPT diagram will appear in these four redshift windows given different sets of assumptions. We show that the position of star-forming galaxies on the BPT diagram traces the interstellar medium conditions and radiation field in galaxies at a given redshift. Galaxies containing active galactic nucleus (AGN) form a mixing sequence with purely star-forming galaxies. This mixing sequence may change dramatically with cosmic time, due to the metallicity sensitivity of the optical emission-lines. Furthermore, the position of the mixing sequence may probe metallicity gradients in galaxies as a function of redshift, depending on the size of the AGN narrow-line region. We apply our latest slow shock models for gas shocked by galactic-scale winds. We show that at high redshift, galactic wind shocks are clearly separated from AGN in line ratio space. Instead, shocks from galactic winds mimic high metallicity starburst galaxies. We discuss our models in the context of future large near-infrared spectroscopic surveys.",

        "abstract": "We use Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 G102 and G141 grism spectroscopy to measure rest-frame optical emission-line ratios of 533 galaxies at z ~ 1.5 in the CANDELS Ly\u03b1 Emission at Reionization survey. We compare [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [S II]/(H\u03b1 + [N II]) as an \"unVO87\" diagram for 461 galaxies and [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [Ne III]/[O II] as an \"OHNO\" diagram for 91 galaxies. The unVO87 diagram does not effectively separate active galactic nuclei (AGN) and [Ne V] sources from star-forming galaxies, indicating that the unVO87 properties of star-forming galaxies evolve with redshift and overlap with AGN emission-line signatures at z &gt; 1. The OHNO diagram does effectively separate X-ray AGN and [Ne V]-emitting galaxies from the rest of the population. We find that the [O III]/H\u03b2 line ratios are significantly anticorrelated with stellar mass and significantly correlated with $\\mathrm{log}({L}_{{\\rm{H}}\\beta })$ , while [S II]/(H\u03b1 + [N II]) is significantly anticorrelated with $\\mathrm{log}({L}_{{\\rm{H}}\\beta })$ . Comparison with MAPPINGS V photoionization models indicates that these trends are consistent with lower metallicity and higher ionization in low-mass and high-star formation rate (SFR) galaxies. We do not find evidence for redshift evolution of the emission-line ratios outside of the correlations with mass and SFR. Our results suggest that the OHNO diagram of [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [Ne III]/[O II] will be a useful indicator of AGN content and gas conditions in very high-redshift galaxies to be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.",

        "title": "Alternative diagnostic diagrams and the `forgotten' population of weak line galaxies in the SDSS",
        "abstract": "A numerous population of weak line galaxies (WLGs) is often left out of statistical studies on emission-line galaxies (ELGs) due to the absence of an adequate classification scheme, since classical diagnostic diagrams, such as [OIII]/H\u03b2 versus [NII]/H\u03b1 (the BPT diagram), require the measurement of at least four emission lines. This paper aims to remedy this situation by transposing the usual divisory lines between star-forming (SF) galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosts and between Seyferts and LINERs to diagrams that are more economical in terms of line quality requirements. By doing this, we rescue from the classification limbo a substantial number of sources and modify the global census of ELGs. More specifically, (1) we use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 to constitute a suitable sample of 280000 ELGs, one-third of which are WLGs. (2) Galaxies with strong emission lines are classified using the widely applied criteria of Kewley et al., Kauffmann et al. and Stasi\u0144ska et al. to distinguish SF galaxies and AGN hosts and Kewley et al. to distinguish Seyferts from LINERs. (3) We transpose these classification schemes to alternative diagrams keeping [NII]/H\u03b1 as a horizontal axis, but replacing H\u03b2 by a stronger line (H\u03b1 or [OII]), or substituting the ionization-level sensitive [OIII]/H\u03b2 ratio with the equivalent width of H\u03b1 (W<SUB>H\u03b1</SUB>). Optimized equations for the transposed divisory lines are provided. (4) We show that nothing significant is lost in the translation, but that the new diagrams allow one to classify up to 50 per cent more ELGs. (5) Introducing WLGs in the census of galaxies in the local Universe increases the proportion of metal-rich SF galaxies and especially LINERs. <P />In the course of this analysis, we were led to make the following points. (i) The Kewley et al. BPT line for galaxy classification is generally ill-used. (ii) Replacing [OIII]/H\u03b2 by W<SUB>H\u03b1</SUB> in the classification introduces a change in the philosophy of the distinction between LINERs and Seyferts, but not in its results. Because the W<SUB>H\u03b1</SUB> versus [NII]/H\u03b1 diagram can be applied to the largest sample of ELGs without loss of discriminating power between Seyferts and LINERs, we recommend its use in further studies. (iii) The dichotomy between Seyferts and LINERs is washed out by WLGs in the BPT plane, but it subsists in other diagnostic diagrams. This suggests that the right wing in the BPT diagram is indeed populated by at least two classes, tentatively identified with bona fide AGN and `retired' galaxies that have stopped forming stars and are ionized by their old stellar populations.",

        "abstract": "We use the statistical power of the MaNGA integral-field spectroscopic galaxy survey to improve the definition of strong line diagnostic boundaries used to classify gas ionization properties in galaxies. We detect line emission from 3.6 million spaxels distributed across 7400 individual galaxies spanning a wide range of stellar masses, star formation rates, and morphological types, and find that the gas-phase velocity dispersion \u03c3<SUB>H\u03b1</SUB> correlates strongly with traditional optical emission-line ratios such as [S II]/H\u03b1, [N II]/H\u03b1, [O I]/H\u03b1, and [O III]/H\u03b2.

Star-forming, AGN, and LI(N)ER regions are additionally well separated from each other in terms of their stellar velocity dispersion, stellar population age, H\u03b1 equivalent width, and typical radius within a given galaxy. We use our observations to revise the traditional emission-line diagnostic classifications so that they reliably identify distinct dynamical samples both in two-dimensional representations of the diagnostic line ratio space and in a multidimensional space that accounts for the complex folding of the star-forming model surface. By comparing the MaNGA observations to the SDSS single-fiber galaxy sample, we note that the latter is systematically biased against young, low-metallicity star-forming regions that lie outside of the 3\u2033 fiber footprint.",

Based on its depth, continuous wavelength coverage from 1 to 5 \u03bcm, and medium spectral resolution (R \u223c 1000), AURORA includes detections of a large suite of nebular emission lines spanning a broad range in rest-frame wavelength. We investigate the locations of AURORA galaxies in multiple different emission-line diagrams, including traditional BPT diagrams of [O III]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 versus [N II]\u03bb6583/H\u03b1, [S II]\u03bb\u03bb6717, 6731/H\u03b1, and [O I]\u03bb6300/H\u03b1, and the ionization\u2013metallicity diagram of [O III]\u03bb5007/[O II]\u03bb3727 (O<SUB>32</SUB>) versus ([O III]\u03bb5007+[O II]\u03bb3727)/H\u03b2 (R<SUB>23</SUB>).

With a significant boost in signal-to-noise ratio and large, representative samples of individual galaxy detections, the AURORA emission-line diagrams presented here definitively confirm a physical picture in which chemically young, \u03b1-enhanced, massive stars photoionize the interstellar medium (ISM) in distant galaxies with a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity than in their z \u223c 0 counterparts. We also uncover previously unseen evolution prior to z \u223c 2 in the [O III]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 versus [N II]\u03bb6583/H\u03b1 diagram, which motivates deep NIRSpec observations at even higher redshift. Finally, we present the first statistical sample of rest-frame near-IR emission-line diagnostics in star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In order to truly interpret rest-frame near-IR line ratios including [Fe II]\u03bb1.257 \u03bcm, we must obtain better constraints on dust depletion in the high-redshift ISM.",

We find the following: (1) the luminosities of all measured narrow lines (H\u03b1, H\u03b2, [O III], [N II], [S II], [O I]) show a Baldwin relation relative to the broad H\u03b1 luminosity L<SUB>bH\u03b1</SUB>, with slopes in the range of 0.53-0.72. (2) About 20 per cent of the type 1 AGN reside within the `Composite' and `star-forming' (SF) regions of the Baldwin, Phillips &amp; Terlevich (BPT) diagrams. These objects also show excess narrow H\u03b1 and ultraviolet (UV) luminosities, for their L<SUB>bH\u03b1</SUB>, consistent with contribution from star formation which dominates the narrow-lines emission, as expected from their positions in the BPT diagrams. (3) The type 1 which reside within the AGN region in the BPT diagrams, are offset to lower [S II]/H\u03b1 and [N II]/H\u03b1 luminosity ratios, compared to type 2 AGN. This offset is a selection effect, related to the lower AGN/host luminosity selection of the type 2 AGN selected from the SDSS galaxy sample. (4) The [N II]/H\u03b1 and [N II]/[S II] ratios in type 1 AGN increase with the host mass, as expected if the mass-metallicity relation of quiescent galaxies holds for the AGN narrow-line region (NLR). (5) The broad lines optical Fe II is higher for a higher [N II]/H\u03b1, at a fixed L<SUB>bol</SUB> and Eddington ratio L/L<SUB>Edd</SUB>. This suggests that the broad line region metallicity is also related to the host mass. (6) The fraction of AGN which are low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) increases sharply with decreasing L/L<SUB>Edd</SUB>. This fraction is the same for type 1 and type 2 AGN.

However, the shift for our rest-frame optically selected sample is less significant than for rest-frame-UV selected and emission-line selected galaxies at z \u223c 2. Furthermore, we find that the offset is mass-dependent, only appearing within the low-mass half of the z \u223c 2.3 MOSDEF sample, where galaxies are shifted toward higher [N ii]/H\u03b1 at fixed [O iii]/H\u03b2.

We explore how these spatially resolved line ratios can inform our interpretation of integrated emission line ratios obtained at high redshift. Many of our galaxies fall in the \"composite\" region of the z ~ 0 [N II]/H\u03b1 versus [O III]/H\u03b2 diagnostic (BPT) diagram, between star-forming galaxies and those with AGNs. Based on our resolved measurements, we find that some of these galaxies likely host an AGN, while others appear to be affected by the presence of shocks possibly caused by an outflow or from an enhanced ionization parameter as compared with H II regions in normal, local star-forming galaxies. We find that the Mass-Excitation (MEx) diagnostic, which separates purely star-forming and AGN hosting local galaxies in the [O III]/H\u03b2 versus stellar mass plane, does not properly separate z ~ 2 galaxies classified according to the BPT diagram. However, if we shift the galaxies based on the offset between the local and z ~ 2 mass-metallicity relation (i.e., to the mass they would have at z ~ 0 with the same metallicity), we find better agreement between the MEx and BPT diagnostics.

For these broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates, we estimate BH masses using standard virial techniques and find a range of 10<SUP>5</SUP> &lt;~ M <SUB>BH</SUB> &lt;~ 10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> and a median of M <SUB>BH</SUB> ~ 2 \u00d7 10<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>. We also detect broad H\u03b1 in 15 galaxies that have narrow-line ratios consistent with star-forming galaxies. Follow-up observations are required to determine if these are true type 1 AGN or if the broad H\u03b1 is from stellar processes. The median absolute magnitude of the host galaxies in our active sample is M<SUB>g</SUB> = -18.1 mag, which is ~1-2 mag fainter than previous samples of AGN hosts with low-mass BHs. This work constrains the smallest galaxies that can form a massive BH, with implications for BH feedback in low-mass galaxies and the origin of the first supermassive BH seeds.",

    "abstract": "Existing star-forming vs. active galactic nucleus (AGN) classification schemes using optical emission-line diagnostics mostly fail for low-metallicity and/or highly star-forming galaxies, missing AGN in typical z ~ 0 dwarfs. To recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey emission-line catalogs overlapping the volume- and mass-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntex (ECO) surveys to determine the AGN percentage in SEL dwarfs. Our photoionization grids show that the [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [S II]/H\u03b1 diagram (S II plot) and [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [O I]/H\u03b1 diagram (O I plot) are less metallicity sensitive and more successful in identifying dwarf AGN than the popular [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [N II]/H\u03b1 diagnostic (N II plot or \"BPT diagram\"). We identify a new category of \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN) classified as star-forming by the N II plot but as AGN by the S II and/or O I plots. Including SF-AGN, we find the z ~ 0 AGN percentage in dwarfs with SELs to be ~3%-16%, far exceeding most previous optical estimates (~1%). The large range in our dwarf AGN percentage reflects differences in spectral fitting methodologies between catalogs. The highly complete nature of RESOLVE and ECO allows us to normalize strong emission-line galaxy statistics to the full galaxy population, reducing the dwarf AGN percentage to ~0.6%-3.0%. The newly identified SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs with halo mass &lt;10<SUP>11.5</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>, where highly efficient cosmic gas accretion is expected. Almost all SF-AGN also have low metallicities (Z \u2272 0.4 Z <SUB>\u2299</SUB>), demonstrating the advantage of our method.",

        "abstract": "We present a modified emission line classification scheme to categorize galaxies as definite star forming, composite, AGN, or star-forming AGN (SF-AGN). This scheme uses a combination of the [NII]/H-alpha (BPT), [SII]/H-alpha, and [OI]/H-alpha emission line diagnostic plots. SF-AGN is a new category of AGN candidates that were previously classified inconsistently among the three diagnostics. Our new scheme aims to identify undetected AGN candidates among dwarf galaxies, determining a better lower limit for the z~0 massive black hole occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies. We use photoionization models to show that the [SII] and [OI] line diagnostics identify AGN in low metallicity dwarf galaxies that are missed by the BPT diagnostic, providing theoretical motivation for using our new scheme. We apply this scheme to galaxies in the z~0 RESOLVE survey, a statistically complete volume-limited census dominated by dwarfs (stellar mass &lt; 10<SUP>9.5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>). For initial classification, we use SDSS MPA-JHU line measurements with S/N &gt; 5 for all relevant emission lines. This S/N cut limits the ~1500 galaxy RESOLVE survey to a sample of 462 galaxies, of which 306 are dwarfs. Including SF-AGN, we find that 5.2% of dwarfs are AGN candidates, compared to 0.3% using the traditional AGN/composite classifications alone. The SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs having moderately high long-term star formation, but not necessarily recent starburst activity. We seek external confirmation of these results by comparisons to archival X-ray, mid-IR, and radio data. We also examine spatially resolved spectroscopy available from the RESOLVE and SAMI surveys for a subset of the candidates to check that AGN signatures appear only near the center of the galaxy. This work sets the stage for follow-up studies of dwarf AGN black hole occupancy, outflows, and mixing fractions of star formation and AGN activity.",

        "abstract": "Finding AGN in metal-poor, gas-rich, star-forming dwarfs is an ongoing challenge, with complementary detection methods sensitive to different dwarf AGN subpopulations. In this study, we compare the statistics and properties of z~0 dwarf AGN in the volume- and mass-limited RESOLVE and ECO surveys found by three methods: (1) comprehensive optical emission-line classification simultaneously using the [O III]/Hb vs. [N II]/Ha (BPT plot), [S II]/Ha, and [O I]/Ha diagnostic plots, (2) a redefined demarcation line for the BPT plot, and (3) mid-IR colour selection. The comprehensive emission-line method finds a new category of AGN in metal-poor, gas-rich, and star-forming dwarfs, contributing to a ~3-15x higher dwarf AGN percentage than previously identified with strong emission lines (Polimera et al., 2022). Each of the three methods identifies AGN in ~1-2% of dwarfs in the full galaxy population. AGN hosts identified by the comprehensive classification method vs. by mid-IR colours appear similar \u2014 mostly dwarfs with high star formation activity, high gas content, and low metallicity \u2014 but there is virtually no overlap in the identified objects. Relatively few AGN hosts identified by the redefined BPT plot are dwarfs, and these few dwarfs differ from those identified by the comprehensive classification method or mid-IR colours in having modest star formation activity, low gas content, and high metallicity. All methods together yield a full-population dwarf AGN percentage of ~3-5%, which falls in the middle of the range of dwarf AGN occupation fractions predicted by current AGN simulations.",

        "abstract": "We provide a multiwavelength census of dwarf Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the volume- and mass-limited RESOLVE and ECO surveys using mid-IR colours, the BPT diagnostic plot with both traditional and alternative demarcations from literature, and our new multi-diagnostic approach revealing the previously overlooked \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN). Emission line flux ratios of SF-AGN position them as star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram but as AGN in at least one of two other diagnostic plots using [OI]/H\u03b1 or [SII]/H\u03b1 instead of the metallicity-sensitive [NII]/H\u03b1 used in the BPT diagram. SF-AGN are common in local dwarf galaxies, and photoionization models confirm their line ratio patterns match those of model low-metallicity, highly star-forming dwarf galaxies with active intermediate-mass black holes. Given the statistically complete nature of these surveys down to baryonic (stellar+gas) masses of ~10<SUP>9.2</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, they give us the opportunity to quote full-population AGN statistics previously unavailable in the dwarf regime. The addition of SF-AGN and bonus AGN from the alternative BPT plot quadruples the optical dwarf AGN percentage from ~1% to ~4% of the full galaxy population (including non-emission line galaxies). Mid-IR colours also identify up to ~4% of all dwarfs as AGN, albeit the status of the mid-IR AGN candidates is less secure than the optical AGN. We find little overlap between methods, hinting at the possibility that they identify AGN hosts at different evolutionary stages. The bonus dwarf AGN from the alternative BPT method mostly have relatively high metallicity and low star formation activity for dwarfs. In contrast, the mid-IR and SF-AGN hosts have more typical metallicities and star formation rates. Assuming all AGN candidates to be valid, the combined multiwavelength z~0 dwarf AGN frequency is ~5-8%, implying that active accretion onto intermediate mass BHs in dwarf galaxies may be more widespread than previously realised, with implications for BH-galaxy coevolution. We further investigate the properties and environments of SF-AGN and their hosts.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the occurrence and properties of actively accreting black holes, known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), is crucial for unraveling the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies across different mass scales. However, existing classification systems for identifying AGN based on optical emission-line diagnostics are primarily optimized for giant galaxies with stellar masses, M\u2217 &gt; 109.5 M\u2299. This poses a significant challenge in detecting AGN in low-metallicity and highly star-forming galaxies, particularly typical z\u223c0 dwarfs. In this work, we uncover AGN in dwarfs that have strong emission lines using a multi-diagnostic classification system that optimizes the use of existing optical diagnostics. Our multi-diagnostic system is more robust and systematic, providing a consistent categorization of galaxies that lack unique classifications. This systematic approach enables the identification of a hidden population of AGN candidates, referred to as Star Forming-AGN (SF-AGN), in metal-poor, gas-rich, star-forming dwarfs at z\u223c0. We apply this system to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys and discover that the percentage of optical AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines ranges from \u223c3-15%, which significantly exceeds previous estimates of \u223c1%.To investigate the frequency of actively accreting black holes in the nearby Universe, we compile a comprehensive inventory of AGN in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, using optical emission line diagnostics, including our multi-diagnostic approach for identifying SF-AGN, and mid-IR color-selection using WISE colors. The statistical completeness of the RESOLVE and ECO surveys allows us to calculate accurate AGN occupation fractions, representing the number of AGN relative to the total number of galaxies within the survey volume, including those that did not meet the criteria for any AGN search sample. Among the entire galaxy population, the percentage of optical and mid-IR AGN in dwarfs is approximately \u223c3-5%, whereas in giants it ranges from \u223c20-33%. Notably, the dwarf AGN percentage is at least double the previous estimates, while the AGN occurrence in giants is consistent with earlier studies. A key finding of this research is that AGN hosted by typical z\u223c0 dwarfs are predominantly classified as SF-AGN or WISE AGN.Subsequently, we extend the optical multi-diagnostic AGN classification system to a large archival dataset based on the SDSS footprint, encompassing 10\u00d7 the number of galaxies. Similar to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, we observe that over half of the dwarf AGN in the archival sample fall into the newly identified SFAGN category. Leveraging the statistical power of this archival dataset, we investigate the relationship between galaxy compactness and AGN activity as a function of mass. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between compactness and AGN percentage in a mass regime where galaxies are transitioning between dwarfs and giants.",

Diagnostic plot classification using BPT diagrams with Strong Emission Lines (SELs) leaves some galaxies ambiguously classified as AGN or Star Forming, suggesting the potential importance of mixed cases. Furthermore, the recently introduced diagnostic plot of [HeII/H-beta] vs. [NII/H-alpha] reveals additional AGN that are missed by a binary BPT classification. These observations motivate the need to use all available spectroscopic information simultaneously in a single Bayesian modeling framework. We also use new grids that self-consistently model different mixing fractions of AGN + Star Formation emission, correctly treating the combined radiation field, unlike older grids that have linearly combined pure AGN and pure Star Forming models to approximate mixed cases. This Bayesian classification gives insight into emission processes for galaxies that are ambiguously and inconsistently classified using traditional diagnostic plots by providing a single multi-dimensional posterior distribution for the AGN - Star Formation mixing fraction based on all available lines. We find that this approach is especially important for the low metallicity dwarfs that dominate our volume-limited local universe surveys.",

However, recent modeling suggests that low-metallicity AGN do not separate from star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram, potentially resulting in unidentified AGN. We present initial results of our efforts to identify low-metallicity AGN in the RESOLVE survey using emission-line profile fitting to search for extended line wings indicative of possible AGN activity. The RESOLVE survey is an excellent test bed as a low-redshift, volume-limited survey dominated by dwarf galaxies.

        "abstract": "Current emission-line-based estimates of the metallicity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at both high and low redshifts indicate that AGN have predominantly solar-to-supersolar metallicities. This leads to the question: do low-metallicity AGN exist? In this paper, we use photoionization models to examine the effects of metallicity variations on the narrow emission-lines from an AGN. We explore a variety of emission-line diagnostics that are useful for identifying AGN with low-metallicity gas. We find that line ratios involving [NII] are the most robust metallicity indicators in galaxies where the primary source of ionization is from the active nucleus. Ratios involving [SII] and [OI] are strongly affected by uncertainties in modelling the density structure of the narrow-line clouds. To test our diagnostics, we turn to an analysis of AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a clear trend in the relative strength of [NII] with the mass of the AGN-host galaxy. The metallicity of the ISM is known to be correlated with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies; our results indicate that a similar trend exists for AGN. We also find that the best-fitting models for typical Seyfert narrow-line regions (NLRs) have supersolar abundances. Although there is a mass-dependent range of a factor of 2-3 in the NLR metallicities of the AGN in our sample, AGN with subsolar metallicities are very rare in the SDSS. Out of a sample of ~23000 Seyfert 2 galaxies, we find only ~40 clear candidates for AGN with NLR abundances that are below solar.",

        "abstract": "We developed a new technique for identifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and studied the nature of low-luminosity AGNs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This is the former part of a series of papers. We develop a new, sensitive method of identifying AGNs in this paper. The emission-line luminosity in a spectrum is the sum of a star-formation component and an AGN component (if present). We demonstrate that an accurate estimate of the star-formation component can be achieved by fitting model spectra, generated with a recent stellar population synthesis code, to a continuum spectrum. By comparing the observed total line luminosity with that attributed to star formation, we can tell whether a galaxy hosts an AGN or not. We compare our method with the commonly used emission-line diagnostics proposed by Baldwin, Phillips, and Terlevich (1981, PASP, 93, 5; hereafter BPT). By this method, we classify 85% of the strong emission-line objects in the same star-formation/AGN as BPT. One unique feature of our method is its sensitivity; it is applicable to nearly twice as many objects as BPT. We further make a comparison between our method and the BPT diagnostics using stacked spectra and selections in X-ray and radio wavelengths. We show that it is overall a sensitive method of identifying AGNs, while our method suffers from incompleteness and contamination as any AGN identification method does so. We emphasize that our method can be applied at high redshifts (up to Z \u223c 1.7 with red-sensitive optical spectrograph) without making any a priori assumptions about the host-galaxy properties. Another unique feature is that it allows us to subtract the emission-line luminosity due to star formation, and to extract the intrinsic AGN luminosity.",

Of the 145 155 galaxies in the catalogue, 62 258 of them are classified as dwarf galaxies, and by employing two AGN selection methods based on emission-line fluxes (BPT and WHAN), 4476 are found to have AGN characteristics in their optical spectra. Regardless of selection method, this study finds no discernible differences in environment between AGN and non-AGN host dwarf galaxies and these results indicate that environment is not an important factor in triggering AGN activity in dwarf galaxies. This is in line with existing literature on environments of regular galaxies with AGNs and suggests universality in terms of reaction to environment across the mass regime. The biases of AGN selection in low-mass galaxies, and the biases of different measures of environment are also considered. It is found that there are several mass trends in emission-line ratios and that the SDSS fibre covers galaxies non-uniformly with redshift. These biases should be accounted for in future work by possibly including other wavelength regimes or mass weighting of emission-line ratios. Lastly, a discussion of the environment estimation methods is included since they may not gauge the desired properties due to factors such as time delay or using loosely constrained proxy parameters.",

This is the case since AGN are usually found in massive, bulge-dominated galaxies that have converted most of their gas into stars by the present epoch. Since AGN metallicity is strongly correlated with stellar mass, low-metallicity AGN are expected to be in low-mass dwarf galaxies. However, until now, searches in low-mass galaxies have only turned up AGN with metallicities around half that of typical AGN, i.e. with solar or slightly subsolar values. We report the discovery of four low-metallicity dwarf galaxies in the Data Release 6 of the Sloan Digital Sky survey, with 12 + log O/H in the range 7.4-8.0, and that appear to harbor an AGN. In the course of a long-range program to search for extremely metal-deficient emission-line dwarf galaxies, we have come across four galaxies with very unusual spectra: the strong permitted emission lines, mainly the H\u03b1 line, show very prominent broad components, with full widths at zero intensity corresponding to velocities varying between 2200 and 3500 km s<SUP>\u22121</SUP>, and extraordinarily large broad H\u03b1 luminosities, varying from 3\u00d710<SUP>41</SUP> to 2\u00d710<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>\u22121</SUP>. The Balmer lines show a very steep decrement, suggesting collisional excitation and that the broad emission comes from very dense gas (N<SUB>e</SUB> \u226b 10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>\u22123</SUP>).
