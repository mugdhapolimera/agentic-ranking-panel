  "title": "RESOLVE and ECO: Finding Low-metallicity z   0 Dwarf AGN Candidates Using Optimized Emission-line Diagnostics",
  "abstract": "Existing star-forming vs. active galactic nucleus (AGN) classification schemes using optical emission-line diagnostics mostly fail for low-metallicity and/or highly star-forming galaxies, missing AGN in typical z ~ 0 dwarfs. To recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey emission-line catalogs overlapping the volume- and mass-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntex (ECO) surveys to determine the AGN percentage in SEL dwarfs. Our photoionization grids show that the [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [S II]/H\u03b1 diagram (S II plot) and [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [O I]/H\u03b1 diagram (O I plot) are less metallicity sensitive and more successful in identifying dwarf AGN than the popular [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [N II]/H\u03b1 diagnostic (N II plot or \"BPT diagram\"). We identify a new category of \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN) classified as star-forming by the N II plot but as AGN by the S II and/or O I plots. Including SF-AGN, we find the z ~ 0 AGN percentage in dwarfs with SELs to be ~3%-16%, far exceeding most previous optical estimates (~1%). The large range in our dwarf AGN percentage reflects differences in spectral fitting methodologies between catalogs. The highly complete nature of RESOLVE and ECO allows us to normalize strong emission-line galaxy statistics to the full galaxy population, reducing the dwarf AGN percentage to ~0.6%-3.0%. The newly identified SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs with halo mass &lt;10<SUP>11.5</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>, where highly efficient cosmic gas accretion is expected. Almost all SF-AGN also have low metallicities (Z \u2272 0.4 Z <SUB>\u2299</SUB>), demonstrating the advantage of our method.",

      "abstract": "We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 \u00d7 10<SUP>5</SUP> and 2 \u00d7 10<SUP>10</SUP> yr at a resolution of 3 \u00c5 across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 \u00c5 for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 \u00c5 to 160 \u03bcm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.",

We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]\u03bb5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong H\u03b4 absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.",

      "abstract": "We construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry and ground-based kinematics. The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M_\u2022. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M_\u2022 and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon ~ L^0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95% confidence level an MDO of mass M_\u2022 ~ 0.006M_bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M_\u2022 = 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M_\u2022. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f ~= 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M_\u2022/M_bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation ~0.51. There is also marginal evidence that M_\u2022 is distributed differently for ``core'' and ``power law'' galaxies, with core galaxies having a somewhat steeper dependence on M_bulge.",

      "abstract": "We have modeled a large sample of infrared starburst galaxies using both the PEGASE v2.0 and STARBURST99 codes to generate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the young star clusters. PEGASE utilizes the Padova group tracks, while STARBURST99 uses the Geneva group tracks, allowing comparison between the two. We used our MAPPINGS III code to compute photoionization models that include a self-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We use the standard optical diagnostic diagrams as indicators of the hardness of the EUV radiation field in these galaxies. These diagnostic diagrams are most sensitive to the spectral index of the ionizing radiation field in the 1-4 ryd region. We find that warm infrared starburst galaxies contain a relatively hard EUV field in this region. The PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in the 1-4 ryd range than that of STARBURST99. As the spectrum in this regime is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, this discrepancy is most likely due to the differences in stellar atmosphere models used for the W-R stars. The PEGASE models use the Clegg &amp; Middlemass planetary nebula nuclei (PNN) atmosphere models for the W-R stars, whereas the STARBURST99 models use the Schmutz, Leitherer, &amp; Gruenwald W-R atmosphere models. We believe that the Schmutz et al. atmospheres are more applicable to the starburst galaxies in our sample; however, they do not produce the hard EUV field in the 1-4 ryd region required by our observations. The inclusion of continuum metal blanketing in the models may be one solution. Supernova remnant (SNR) shock modeling shows that the contribution by mechanical energy from SNRs to the photoionization models is &lt;&lt;20%.

We show that Seyferts and low-ionization narrow emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus-HII (AGN-HII) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [OIII] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [OIII] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[OIII]/\u03c3<SUP>4</SUP>, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixed L[OIII]/\u03c3<SUP>4</SUP>, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/L<SUB>EDD</SUB> and Seyferts dominant at high L/L<SUB>EDD</SUB>. These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than required by Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.",
