Multiple results provide detailed descriptions of the proposed multi-diagnostic emission line classification scheme and its application to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys to identify low-metallicity dwarf AGN candidates. For example, Result 1 outlines the key aspects of using the [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha, and [OI]/Halpha diagnostics in combination to identify a new category of 'star-forming AGN' in low-metallicity dwarfs. Result 3 then expands on these initial findings, quantifying the increased percentage of dwarf AGN identified compared to previous methods. This set gives the clearest understanding of the paper's novel approach.",

        "improvement_suggestions": [
            "For Set 1, including more results specifically on low-metallicity AGN identification methods would increase the relevance",
            "Set 2 could be improved by adding more technical details on the multi-diagnostic classification scheme itself, beyond just the motivation and goals",
            "While very focused, Set 3 could benefit from some additional context on previous emission line diagnostic methods and their limitations for dwarf galaxies"
