For example, Result 1 introduces a modified scheme using [S II]/Hα and [O I]/Hα, mirroring the main paper’s approach. Result 4 quantifies AGN occupation fractions in dwarfs, while Result 5 applies Bayesian methods to resolve AGN/star-formation mixing. Set 3’s focus on z~0 dwarfs and the same surveys as the main paper makes it uniquely suited to validate and extend the main study’s conclusions.",

        "improvement_suggestions": [
            "Set 1 could include papers on metallicity-dependent AGN diagnostics and RESOLVE/ECO data.",
            "Set 2 would benefit from excluding high-z studies and adding more RESOLVE/ECO-focused results.",
            "Both Sets 1 and 2 lack the SF-AGN classification specificity central to the main paper."
