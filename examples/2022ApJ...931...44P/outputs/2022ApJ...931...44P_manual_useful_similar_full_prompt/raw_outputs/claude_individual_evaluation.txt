        "1": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant to the main paper. It presents a new sample of AGNs in dwarf galaxies identified using spatially-resolved spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey. The methodology of using emission-line diagnostics to identify AGNs in dwarf galaxies is closely aligned with the main paper's approach. The results also support the main paper's findings of a higher AGN fraction in dwarfs compared to previous single-fiber studies."},
        "2": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is also highly relevant to the main paper. It presents a large sample of dwarf AGN candidates identified using DESI data and emission-line diagnostics. The methodology and findings are directly relevant to the main paper's topic of identifying AGNs in dwarf galaxies using optimized emission-line diagnostics. The higher AGN fraction found in dwarfs and the extension of the M_BH-M_star relation to lower masses are consistent with the main paper's results."},
        "3": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant to the main paper's topic of using emission-line diagnostics to identify AGNs, but it focuses on more massive galaxies rather than dwarfs. The analysis of X-ray AGNs in the star-forming region of the BPT diagram provides insights into the reliability of emission-line diagnostics, which is relevant to the main paper's methodology. However, the specific focus on massive galaxies makes it less directly aligned with the main paper's emphasis on dwarf galaxies."},
        "4": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant to the main paper's topic of identifying AGNs in low-mass galaxies using emission-line diagnostics. The methodology of using the BPT diagram, He II line, and mid-IR colors to select AGN candidates in low-mass galaxies is similar to the approach used in the main paper. However, the focus is on a broader range of low-mass galaxies rather than specifically dwarf galaxies, making it somewhat less directly aligned with the main paper's emphasis."},
        "5": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant to the main paper's topic of identifying AGNs in dwarf galaxies using emission-line diagnostics. The analysis of AGN-like line ratios in isolated quiescent dwarf galaxies provides insights into the presence of AGNs in this specific population. While the focus is not directly on identifying AGNs in star-forming dwarfs, the methodology of using emission-line diagnostics and the findings related to AGNs in low-mass systems are relevant to the main paper."},
        "6": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant to the main paper. It presents a sample of dwarf galaxies exhibiting optical spectroscopic signatures of accreting massive black holes, which is directly aligned with the main paper's topic. The methodology of using emission-line diagnostics to identify AGNs in dwarf galaxies and estimate black hole masses is closely aligned with the main paper's approach. The results also support the main paper's findings of a higher AGN fraction in dwarfs compared to previous studies."},
        "7": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant to the main paper's topic of identifying low-mass black holes in active galaxies using emission-line diagnostics. While the focus is not specifically on dwarf galaxies, the methodology of using broad emission lines and virial mass estimates to identify low-mass black holes is relevant to the main paper's approach. The sample of low-mass black holes in late-type galaxies provides insights into the connection between black holes and their host galaxies, which is relevant to the main paper's discussion."},
        "8": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant to the main paper's topic of using emission-line diagnostics to identify low-metallicity AGNs. The analysis of how metallicity variations affect AGN emission lines and the investigation of metallicity trends in SDSS AGNs provide insights relevant to the main paper's methodology of optimizing emission-line diagnostics for low-metallicity dwarf AGNs. However, the focus is not specifically on dwarf galaxies, making it somewhat less directly aligned with the main paper's emphasis."},
        "9": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant to the main paper's topic of using emission-line diagnostics to study star-forming galaxies, particularly at low metallicities. The generation of photoionization models and comparison with local galaxy samples, including low-metallicity galaxies, is relevant to the main paper's methodology of optimizing emission-line diagnostics for low-metallicity dwarf AGNs. However, the focus is primarily on star-forming galaxies rather than identifying AGNs in dwarfs, making it somewhat less directly aligned with the main paper's emphasis."},
        "10": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant to the main paper. It presents X-ray and UV observations of optically-selected broad-line AGN candidates in nearby dwarf galaxies, confirming their AGN nature. The methodology of using multi-wavelength data to identify and characterize AGNs in dwarf galaxies is closely aligned with the main paper's approach. The results also support the main paper's findings of the presence of AGNs in dwarf galaxies and provide additional insights into their properties."},
        "11": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant to the main paper's topic of using emission-line diagnostics to separate different ionization sources in galaxies. The methodology of using a new 3D diagnostic diagram to separate line emission from star formation, shocks, and AGN is relevant to the main paper's goal of optimizing emission-line diagnostics for identifying AGNs in dwarf galaxies. However, the specific focus is on the nearby galaxy NGC 1068 rather than dwarf galaxies, making it somewhat less directly aligned with the main paper's emphasis."},
        "12": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant to the main paper. It presents spectroscopic observations of AGNs with some of the lowest known black hole masses, which is directly relevant to the main paper's focus on low-mass and dwarf galaxies. The analysis of emission-line properties and comparisons with higher-mass AGNs provide insights relevant to the main paper's methodology of optimizing emission-line diagnostics for dwarf AGNs. The findings related to potential low-metallicity AGNs and trends in emission-line properties are closely aligned with the main paper's goals."},
        "13": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant to the main paper's topic of studying massive black holes in dwarf galaxies. The analysis of cosmological simulations to investigate the properties and observability of MBHs in dwarfs is relevant to the main paper's focus. However, the emphasis is more on the gravitational wave signatures of MBH mergers rather than the identification and characterization of dwarf AGNs using emission-line diagnostics, making it somewhat less directly aligned with the main paper's methodology."}
