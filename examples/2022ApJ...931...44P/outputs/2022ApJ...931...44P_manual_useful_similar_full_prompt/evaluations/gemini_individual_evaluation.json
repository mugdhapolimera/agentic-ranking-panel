      "explanation": "This paper directly addresses the identification of AGN in dwarf galaxies using emission-line diagnostics, which is the central theme of the main paper. It uses a spatially-resolved approach with the same emission-line diagrams (BPT, S II, O I) to identify AGN, including SF-AGN. The large sample size and discussion of the AGN fraction make it highly relevant."
    },
    "2": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant as it focuses on finding AGN in dwarf galaxies using emission-line diagnostics (BPT diagram). The finding of a higher AGN fraction in dwarf galaxies aligns with the main paper's argument that traditional methods underestimate the AGN population. However, it primarily uses the BPT diagram, while the main paper emphasizes the S II and O I diagrams as being more effective, making it less directly aligned."
    },
    "3": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This paper discusses the reliability of the BPT diagram for excluding AGN, which is tangentially related to the main paper's focus on identifying AGN in dwarf galaxies. It touches on the limitations of the BPT diagram, a point that the main paper also makes, but its focus is on more massive galaxies and the general reliability of the BPT diagram, not specifically on dwarf galaxies or alternative diagnostics."
    },
    "4": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This paper is relevant because it investigates AGN activity in low-mass galaxies using optical emission-line diagnostics, including the BPT diagram. The comparison of different selection criteria and the resulting AGN fraction are relevant to the main paper's discussion of the challenges in identifying AGN in dwarfs. However, it doesn't explicitly focus on the S II and O I diagnostics that the main paper advocates."
    },
    "5": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This paper's investigation of AGN-like line ratios in low-mass quiescent galaxies is relevant to the main paper's topic. The finding that many quiescent galaxies host AGN-like line ratios, which were missed by SDSS due to spatial resolution, aligns with the idea that AGN in low-mass galaxies are often overlooked. The use of emission-line diagnostics connects to the main paper's methodology, but it doesn't directly address the specific diagnostics (S II, O I) promoted in the main paper."
    },
    "6": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This paper is highly relevant as it presents a sample of dwarf galaxies with optical spectroscopic signatures of accreting massive black holes. It directly addresses the identification of AGN in dwarf galaxies using emission-line diagnostics (N II plot). The increase in the number of known active galaxies in this stellar-mass range is a significant contribution to the field. While it primarily uses the N II plot, its direct focus on dwarf AGN makes it very relevant."
    },
    "7": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This paper focuses on identifying a sample of low-mass black holes in active galaxies. While related to the general topic of AGN and black holes in galaxies, it doesn't specifically focus on dwarf galaxies or the optimization of emission-line diagnostics for their identification. The broad-line selection criteria differ from the narrow-line diagnostics emphasized in the main paper, making it only somewhat relevant."
    },
    "8": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This paper directly addresses the emission-line diagnostics of low-metallicity AGN, which is a key point in the main paper. The use of photoionization models to examine the effects of metallicity on emission lines and the analysis of SDSS data are relevant methodologies. However, it concludes that subsolar metallicity AGN are rare, which is a somewhat contrasting finding to the main paper's implication that they are more common when using the S II and O I diagnostics."
    },
    "9": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This paper focuses on theoretical modeling of star-forming galaxies and emission-line diagnostic grids. While it touches on low-metallicity galaxies, its primary focus is on star formation and the limitations of current models. The connection to the main paper is tangential, as it doesn't directly address AGN or the specific diagnostic diagrams discussed in the main paper."
    },
    "10": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This paper is highly relevant as it presents X-ray and UV observations of optically selected broad-line AGN candidates in nearby dwarf galaxies. It provides strong confirmation of the AGN nature of these dwarf galaxies, which aligns with the main paper's goal of finding and characterizing AGN in dwarfs. The use of broad-line AGN candidates is somewhat different from the main paper's focus on narrow-line diagnostics, but the overall topic and findings are highly relevant."
    },
    "11": {
      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "This paper focuses on separating line emission from star formation, shocks, and AGN in NGC 1068, a specific galaxy. While it deals with AGN and emission lines, it doesn't focus on dwarf galaxies, low-metallicity environments, or optimizing diagnostics for dwarf AGN identification, making it not relevant."
    },
    "12": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This paper is relevant as it presents spectroscopic observations of AGN with low black hole masses and investigates their emission-line properties. The comparison with higher-mass BH AGN and the discussion of metallicity are relevant to the main paper's themes. However, it doesn't explicitly focus on the S II and O I diagnostics or the identification of SF-AGN in the same way as the main paper."
    },
    "13": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This paper focuses on simulations of massive black holes in dwarf galaxies and their multimessenger signatures. While it touches on the topic of MBHs in dwarfs, it primarily discusses the theoretical observability and merger history of these MBHs, rather than the observational identification using optical emission-line diagnostics. Therefore, it is only somewhat relevant."
