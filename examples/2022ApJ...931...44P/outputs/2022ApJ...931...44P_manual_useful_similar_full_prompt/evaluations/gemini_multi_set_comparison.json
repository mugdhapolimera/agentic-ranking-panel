      "strengths": [
        "Includes papers on emission-line classification schemes relevant to AGN identification.",
        "Contains papers discussing the properties of AGN host galaxies.",
        "Presents research on the mass-metallicity relation in star-forming galaxies, which is related to the metallicity considerations in the main paper.",
        "Includes papers on stellar population synthesis, useful for understanding galaxy properties and emission line origins.",
        "Includes papers discussing the host galaxies and classification of active galactic nuclei"

      "weaknesses": [
        "Some results are only tangentially related (e.g., stellar population synthesis at a specific resolution).",
        "The result on massive dark objects is less directly relevant to the specific emission-line diagnostics used in the main paper.",
        "No results directly mention the RESOLVE or ECO surveys.",
        "Lacks a specific focus on dwarf AGN and low-metallicity environments."
      ],
      "summary": "Set 1 contains some relevant papers on AGN classification and host galaxy properties, but lacks focus on dwarf galaxies, low metallicity, and the specific surveys (RESOLVE/ECO) mentioned in the main paper. It includes some results that are only indirectly relevant."

    "2": {
      "strengths": [
        "Directly addresses dwarf AGN and mentions the RESOLVE and ECO surveys.",
        "Discusses alternative diagnostic diagrams, which is a key aspect of the main paper.",
        "Includes a paper specifically on 'star-forming AGN' (SF-AGN), a key category identified in the main paper.",
        "Covers emission-line ratios at high redshift, providing context for the evolution of AGN properties.",
        "Includes a paper that focuses on alternative diagnostic diagrams and the 'forgotten' population of weak line galaxies in SDSS, relevant for completeness and identifying biases in AGN selection.",
        "Includes paper discussing the excitation properties of z ~ 2.3 Star-forming Galaxies"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Some results focus on high-redshift galaxies, which is less directly relevant to the z ~ 0 focus of the main paper.",
        "Not all results explicitly focus on low-metallicity environments, although the connection is often implied."
      ],
      "summary": "Set 2 is highly relevant, directly addressing dwarf AGN in the RESOLVE/ECO surveys and discussing alternative diagnostic diagrams. It also includes results on SF-AGN, a key finding of the main paper. Some results are less directly relevant due to their focus on high-redshift galaxies, but overall, this set is strong."

    "3": {
      "strengths": [
        "Strongest set, as it directly addresses the main paper's focus on low-metallicity dwarf AGN in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys.",
        "Includes papers on modified emission-line classification schemes, comparing methods of finding dwarf AGN, and the abundance of dwarf AGN.",
        "Features multiple papers directly related to the RESOLVE survey and the identification of SF-AGN.",
        "Addresses AGN/star formation mixing fractions and efforts to detect low-metallicity AGN.",
        "Discusses the environments of dwarf galaxies with optical AGN characteristics.",

      "summary": "Set 3 is the most relevant and comprehensive, with multiple papers directly addressing the research question of the main paper. It focuses on low-metallicity dwarf AGN in the RESOLVE/ECO surveys, discusses modified classification schemes, and explores the properties and environments of these AGN. This set provides the most direct support and context for understanding the main paper."

  "comparison": {
    "best_set": 3,
    "justification": "Set 3 is the best because it contains the highest concentration of papers directly relevant to the main paper's research question. For example, 'Finding Low-Metallicity Dwarf AGN Candidates at z 0 using the RESOLVE Survey' directly reflects the main paper's title and objective. Furthermore, 'Comparing Methods of Finding z 0 Dwarf AGN using the RESOLVE and ECO Surveys' and 'Surprisingly Abundant Dwarf AGN in the RESOLVE and ECO z 0 AGN Census' directly utilize the same surveys and address similar methodologies (emission-line diagnostics, alternative BPT plots, mid-IR colors). Set 3 also includes results on AGN/star formation mixing fractions and efforts to detect low-metallicity AGN using emission-line profiles which are all highly relevant. In contrast, Set 1 contains broader papers, and Set 2 contains a mix of relevant and less-relevant high redshift papers. Set 3 consistently focuses on the key aspects of the main paper: low-metallicity, dwarf AGN, emission-line diagnostics, and the RESOLVE/ECO surveys.",
    "key_differences": [
      "Set 3 has the most direct relevance to the main paper's specific research question.",
      "Sets 1 and 2 include some results that are only tangentially related, while Set 3 is consistently focused.",
      "Set 3 has the strongest coverage of the RESOLVE and ECO surveys.",
      "Set 3 directly addresses the issue of SF-AGN, a key category in the main paper.",
      "Set 1 lacks a specific focus on dwarf AGN and low-metallicity environments."
    ],
    "improvement_suggestions": [
      "For Set 1, including more papers specifically focused on dwarf galaxies and low-metallicity environments would improve its relevance. Adding papers that mention the RESOLVE or ECO surveys would also be beneficial.",
      "For Set 2, prioritizing results that are directly focused on z ~ 0 galaxies, rather than high-redshift galaxies, would increase its relevance to the main paper. More papers specifically addressing low-metallicity environments would also be beneficial.",
      "For Set 3, while it is already the best set, ensuring that future searches minimize overlap between different results would be helpful."
