Results 1–8 and 10–12 are perfect matches to the main paper's focus, while the first set has only a few relevant papers (e.g., Results 2, 7, 8) and lacks specificity to dwarfs. The second set's ranking places the most relevant results (e.g., MAD, DESI, low-metallicity diagnostics) at the top, ensuring high utility for the main paper's research questions."
