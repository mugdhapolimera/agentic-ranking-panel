To recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey emission-line catalogs overlapping the volume- and mass-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntex (ECO) surveys to determine the AGN percentage in SEL dwarfs. Our photoionization grids show that the [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [S II]/H\u03b1 diagram (S II plot) and [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [O I]/H\u03b1 diagram (O I plot) are less metallicity sensitive and more successful in identifying dwarf AGN than the popular [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [N II]/H\u03b1 diagnostic (N II plot or \"BPT diagram\"). We identify a new category of \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN) classified as star-forming by the N II plot but as AGN by the S II and/or O I plots. Including SF-AGN, we find the z ~ 0 AGN percentage in dwarfs with SELs to be ~3%-16%, far exceeding most previous optical estimates (~1%). The large range in our dwarf AGN percentage reflects differences in spectral fitting methodologies between catalogs. The highly complete nature of RESOLVE and ECO allows us to normalize strong emission-line galaxy statistics to the full galaxy population, reducing the dwarf AGN percentage to ~0.6%-3.0%.

        "abstract": "We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 \u00d7 10<SUP>5</SUP> and 2 \u00d7 10<SUP>10</SUP> yr at a resolution of 3 \u00c5 across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 \u00c5 for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 \u00c5 to 160 \u03bcm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.",

We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]\u03bb5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong H\u03b4 absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.",

The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M_\u2022. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M_\u2022 and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon ~ L^0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95% confidence level an MDO of mass M_\u2022 ~ 0.006M_bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M_\u2022 = 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M_\u2022. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f ~= 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M_\u2022/M_bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation ~0.51. There is also marginal evidence that M_\u2022 is distributed differently for ``core'' and ``power law'' galaxies, with core galaxies having a somewhat steeper dependence on M_bulge.",

        "abstract": "We have modeled a large sample of infrared starburst galaxies using both the PEGASE v2.0 and STARBURST99 codes to generate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the young star clusters. PEGASE utilizes the Padova group tracks, while STARBURST99 uses the Geneva group tracks, allowing comparison between the two. We used our MAPPINGS III code to compute photoionization models that include a self-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We use the standard optical diagnostic diagrams as indicators of the hardness of the EUV radiation field in these galaxies. These diagnostic diagrams are most sensitive to the spectral index of the ionizing radiation field in the 1-4 ryd region. We find that warm infrared starburst galaxies contain a relatively hard EUV field in this region. The PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in the 1-4 ryd range than that of STARBURST99. As the spectrum in this regime is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, this discrepancy is most likely due to the differences in stellar atmosphere models used for the W-R stars. The PEGASE models use the Clegg &amp; Middlemass planetary nebula nuclei (PNN) atmosphere models for the W-R stars, whereas the STARBURST99 models use the Schmutz, Leitherer, &amp; Gruenwald W-R atmosphere models. We believe that the Schmutz et al. atmospheres are more applicable to the starburst galaxies in our sample; however, they do not produce the hard EUV field in the 1-4 ryd region required by our observations. The inclusion of continuum metal blanketing in the models may be one solution. Supernova remnant (SNR) shock modeling shows that the contribution by mechanical energy from SNRs to the photoionization models is &lt;&lt;20%. The models presented here are used to derive a new theoretical classification scheme for starbursts and active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies based on the optical diagnostic diagrams.",

We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus-HII (AGN-HII) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [OIII] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [OIII] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[OIII]/\u03c3<SUP>4</SUP>, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate.

Yet, how AGNs in dwarf galaxies form is still debated, in part due to scant demographics. We use the MaNGA survey, comprising ~10 000 galaxies at z &lt; 0.15, to identify AGN dwarf galaxies using a spaxel-by-spaxel classification in three spatially-resolved emission-line diagnostic diagrams (the [N II]-, [S II]-, and [O I]-BPT) and the WHAN diagram.

This can be explained by the lower bolometric luminosity (&lt;10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and accretion rate (sub-Eddington) of the MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies. We additionally identify 1176 SF-AGNs (classified as star-forming in the [N II]-BPT but as AGNs in the [S II]- and [O I]-BPT), 122 Composite, and 173 LINER sources.

Taking X-ray detectability into account, we find that the average fraction of X-ray AGNs in the BPT star-forming branch is 2%, suggesting the BPT diagram can provide a reasonably clean sample of star-forming galaxies. However, the X-ray selection is itself rather incomplete. At the tip of the AGN branch of the BPT diagram, the X-ray AGN fraction is only 14%, which may have implications for studies that exclude AGNs based only on X-ray observations. Interestingly, the X-ray AGN fractions are similar for Seyfert and LINER populations, consistent with LINERs being true AGNs. We find that neither the star formation dilution nor the hidden broad-line components can satisfactorily explain the apparent misclassification of X-ray AGNs. On the other hand, \u223c40% of all X-ray AGNs have weak emission lines such that they cannot be placed on the BPT diagram at all and often have low specific SFRs.

This population may represent the lowest stellar mass galaxies in which internal feedback quenches galaxy-wide star formation. We present a Keck/Echelle Spectrograph and Imager long-slit spectroscopy for 27 isolated galaxies in this regime (20 quiescent galaxies and 7 star-forming galaxies). We measure emission line strengths as a function of radius and place galaxies on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. Remarkably, 16 of 20 quiescent galaxies in our sample host central active galactic nucleus (AGN)-like line ratios. Only five of these quiescent galaxies were identified as AGN-like in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey due to a lower spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We find that many of the quiescent galaxies in our sample have spatially extended emission across the non-star-forming regions of BPT-space. While quenched galaxies in denser environments in this mass range often show no evidence for AGN activity, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies in isolation host AGNs despite their overall passive appearances.",

Utilizing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 and stellar masses from the NASA-Sloan Atlas, we have systematically searched for active BHs in ~25,000 emission-line galaxies with stellar masses comparable to the Magellanic Clouds and redshifts z &lt; 0.055. Using the narrow-line [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [N II]/H\u03b1 diagnostic diagram, we find photoionization signatures of BH accretion in 136 galaxies, a small fraction of which also exhibit broad H\u03b1 emission. For these broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates, we estimate BH masses using standard virial techniques and find a range of 10<SUP>5</SUP> &lt;~ M <SUB>BH</SUB> &lt;~ 10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> and a median of M <SUB>BH</SUB> ~ 2 \u00d7 10<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>. We also detect broad H\u03b1 in 15 galaxies that have narrow-line ratios consistent with star-forming galaxies. Follow-up observations are required to determine if these are true type 1 AGN or if the broad H\u03b1 is from stellar processes. The median absolute magnitude of the host galaxies in our active sample is M<SUB>g</SUB> = -18.1 mag, which is ~1-2 mag fainter than previous samples of AGN hosts with low-mass BHs. This work constrains the smallest galaxies that can form a massive BH, with implications for BH feedback in low-mass galaxies and the origin of the first supermassive BH seeds.",

        "abstract": "We present an expanded sample of low-mass black holes (BHs) found in galactic nuclei. Using standard virial mass techniques to estimate BH masses, we select from the Fourth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey all broad-line active galaxies with masses &lt;2\u00d710<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. BHs in this mass regime provide unique tests of the relationship between BHs and galaxies, since their late-type galaxy hosts do not necessarily contain classical bulges. Furthermore, they provide observational analogs of primordial seed BHs and are expected, when merging, to provide strong gravitational signals for future detectors such as LISA. From our preliminary sample of 19, we have increased the total sample by an order of magnitude to 174, as well as an additional 55 (less secure) candidates. The sample has a median BH mass of &lt;M<SUB>BH</SUB>&gt;=1.3\u00d710<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, and in general the objects are radiating at high fractions of their Eddington limits.

Much like the preliminary sample, these objects are predominantly radio-quiet (R\u2261f<SUB>6cm</SUB>/f<SUB>4400\u00c5</SUB>&lt;10), but 11 objects are detected at 20 cm, with radio powers (10<SUP>21</SUP>-10<SUP>23</SUP> W Hz<SUP>-1</SUP>) that may arise from either star formation or nuclear activity; only 1% of the sample is radio-loud. We further confirm that, with &lt;M<SUB>g</SUB>&gt;=-19.3 and &lt;g-r&gt;=0.7 mag, the host galaxies are low-mass, late-type systems. At least 40% show disklike morphologies, and the combination of host galaxy colors and higher order Balmer absorption lines indicate intermediate-age stellar populations in a subset of the sample.",

        "abstract": "Current emission-line-based estimates of the metallicity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at both high and low redshifts indicate that AGN have predominantly solar-to-supersolar metallicities. This leads to the question: do low-metallicity AGN exist? In this paper, we use photoionization models to examine the effects of metallicity variations on the narrow emission-lines from an AGN. We explore a variety of emission-line diagnostics that are useful for identifying AGN with low-metallicity gas. We find that line ratios involving [NII] are the most robust metallicity indicators in galaxies where the primary source of ionization is from the active nucleus. Ratios involving [SII] and [OI] are strongly affected by uncertainties in modelling the density structure of the narrow-line clouds. To test our diagnostics, we turn to an analysis of AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a clear trend in the relative strength of [NII] with the mass of the AGN-host galaxy. The metallicity of the ISM is known to be correlated with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies; our results indicate that a similar trend exists for AGN. We also find that the best-fitting models for typical Seyfert narrow-line regions (NLRs) have supersolar abundances. Although there is a mass-dependent range of a factor of 2-3 in the NLR metallicities of the AGN in our sample, AGN with subsolar metallicities are very rare in the SDSS. Out of a sample of ~23000 Seyfert 2 galaxies, we find only ~40 clear candidates for AGN with NLR abundances that are below solar.",

        "abstract": "We use the newest generation of the Starburst99/Mappings code to generate an extensive suite of models to facilitate detailed studies of star-forming galaxies and their interstellar medium properties, particularly at low metallicities. The new models used include a rigorous treatment of metal opacities in the population synthesis modeling and more detailed dust physics in the photoionization code. These models span a wide range of physical parameters including metallicity, ionization parameter, and the adoption of both an instantaneous burst and continuous star formation history (SFH). We examine the agreement between our models and local (z &lt; 0.1) star-forming galaxy populations from several large data sets, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey, and samples of blue compact galaxies and metal-poor galaxies. We find that models adopting a continuous SFH reproduce the metallicity-sensitive line ratios observed in the local population of star-forming galaxies, including the low-metallicity sample. However, we find that the current codes generate an insufficiently hard ionizing radiation field, leading to deficiencies in the [S II] fluxes produced by the models. We consider the advantages and shortcomings of this suite of models, and discuss future work and improvements that can be applied to the modeling of star-forming galaxies.",

Including archival Chandra observations of three additional sources, our sample contains all 10 galaxies from Reines et al. (2013) with both broad H\u03b1 emission and narrow-line AGN ratios (six AGNs, four composites), as well as one low-metallicity dwarf galaxy with broad H\u03b1 and narrow-line ratios characteristic of star formation. All 11 galaxies are detected in X-rays. Nuclear X-ray luminosities range from L <SUB>0.5-7keV</SUB> \u2248 5 \u00d7 10<SUP>39</SUP> to 1 \u00d7 10<SUP>42</SUP> ergs<SUP>-1</SUP>. In all cases except for the star-forming galaxy, the nuclear X-ray luminosities are significantly higher than would be expected from X-ray binaries, providing strong confirmation that AGNs and composite dwarf galaxies do indeed host actively accreting black holes (BHs). Using our estimated BH masses (which range from \u223c7 \u00d7 10<SUP>4</SUP> to 1 \u00d7 10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>), we find inferred Eddington fractions ranging from \u223c0.1% to 50%, I.e., comparable to massive broad-line quasars at higher redshift. We use the HST imaging to determine the ratio of UV to X-ray emission for these AGNs, finding that they appear to be less X-ray luminous with respect to their UV emission than more massive quasars (I.e., \u03b1 <SUB>OX</SUB> values an average of 0.36 lower than expected based on the relation between \u03b1 <SUB>OX</SUB> and 2500 \u00c5 luminosity).

        "abstract": "In the optical spectra of galaxies, the separation of line emission from gas ionized by star formation and an active galactic nucleus (AGN), or by star formation and shocks, are very well-understood problems. However, separating line emission between AGN and shocks has proven difficult. With the aid of a new three-dimensional diagnostic diagram, we show the simultaneous separation of line emission from star formation, shocks, and AGN in NGC 1068, and quantify the ratio of star formation, shocks, and AGN in each spaxel. The AGN, shock, and star formation luminosity distributions across the galaxy accurately align with X-ray, radio, and CO(3-2) observations, respectively. Comparisons with previous separation methods show that the shocked emission heavily mixes with the AGN emission. We also show that if the H \u03b1 flux is to be used as a star formation rate indicator, separating line emission from as many sources as possible should be attempted to ensure accurate results.",

We use the high spectral resolution and small aperture of our Keck data, taken with the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager, to isolate the narrow-line regions (NLRs) of these low-mass BHs. We investigate their emission-line properties and compare them with those of AGNs with higher-mass BHs. While we are unable to determine absolute metallicities, some of our objects plausibly represent examples of the low-metallicity AGNs described by Groves et al., based on their [N II]/H\u03b1 ratios and their consistency with the Kewley &amp; Ellison mass-metallicity relation. We find tentative evidence for steeper far-UV spectral slopes in lower-mass systems. Overall, NLR emission lines in these low-mass AGNs exhibit trends similar to those seen in AGNs with higher-mass BHs, such as increasing blueshifts and broadening with increasing ionization potential. Additionally, we see evidence of an intermediate-line region whose intensity correlates with L/L <SUB>Edd</SUB>, as seen in higher-mass AGNs. We highlight the interesting trend that, at least in these low-mass AGNs, the [O III] equivalent width (EW) is highest in symmetric NLR lines with no blue wing. This trend of increasing [O III] EW with line symmetry could be explained by a high covering factor of lower-ionization gas in the NLR. In general, low-mass AGNs preserve many well-known trends in the structure of the NLR, while exhibiting steeper ionizing continuum slopes and somewhat lower gas-phase metallicities.",

Systematic searches are revealing more candidates, but this process could be accelerated by predictions from simulations. We perform a study of several high-resolution, cosmological, zoom-in simulations focusing on dwarf galaxies that host massive black holes at z = 0, with the aim of determining when the black holes are most observable. Larger dwarf galaxies are more likely to host MBHs than those of lower mass. About 50 per cent of the MBHs in dwarfs are not centrally located, but rather are wandering within a few kpc of the galaxy centre. The accretion luminosities of MBHs in dwarfs are low throughout cosmic time, rendering them extremely difficult to detect. However, the merger history of these MBHs is optimal for gravitational wave detection by LISA.",
