  "title": "RESOLVE and ECO: Finding Low-metallicity z   0 Dwarf AGN Candidates Using Optimized Emission-line Diagnostics",
  "abstract": "Existing star-forming vs. active galactic nucleus (AGN) classification schemes using optical emission-line diagnostics mostly fail for low-metallicity and/or highly star-forming galaxies, missing AGN in typical z ~ 0 dwarfs. To recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey emission-line catalogs overlapping the volume- and mass-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntex (ECO) surveys to determine the AGN percentage in SEL dwarfs. Our photoionization grids show that the [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [S II]/H\u03b1 diagram (S II plot) and [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [O I]/H\u03b1 diagram (O I plot) are less metallicity sensitive and more successful in identifying dwarf AGN than the popular [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [N II]/H\u03b1 diagnostic (N II plot or \"BPT diagram\"). We identify a new category of \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN) classified as star-forming by the N II plot but as AGN by the S II and/or O I plots. Including SF-AGN, we find the z ~ 0 AGN percentage in dwarfs with SELs to be ~3%-16%, far exceeding most previous optical estimates (~1%). The large range in our dwarf AGN percentage reflects differences in spectral fitting methodologies between catalogs. The highly complete nature of RESOLVE and ECO allows us to normalize strong emission-line galaxy statistics to the full galaxy population, reducing the dwarf AGN percentage to ~0.6%-3.0%. The newly identified SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs with halo mass &lt;10<SUP>11.5</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>, where highly efficient cosmic gas accretion is expected. Almost all SF-AGN also have low metallicities (Z \u2272 0.4 Z <SUB>\u2299</SUB>), demonstrating the advantage of our method.",

      "abstract": "We use the chemical evolution predictions of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with our latest theoretical stellar population synthesis, photoionization, and shock models to predict the strong line evolution of ensembles of galaxies from z = 3 to the present day. In this paper, we focus on the brightest optical emission-line ratios, [N II]/H\u03b1 and [O III]/H\u03b2. We use the optical diagnostic Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram as a tool for investigating the spectral properties of ensembles of active galaxies. We use four redshift windows chosen to exploit new near-infrared multi-object spectrographs. We predict how the BPT diagram will appear in these four redshift windows given different sets of assumptions. We show that the position of star-forming galaxies on the BPT diagram traces the interstellar medium conditions and radiation field in galaxies at a given redshift. Galaxies containing active galactic nucleus (AGN) form a mixing sequence with purely star-forming galaxies. This mixing sequence may change dramatically with cosmic time, due to the metallicity sensitivity of the optical emission-lines. Furthermore, the position of the mixing sequence may probe metallicity gradients in galaxies as a function of redshift, depending on the size of the AGN narrow-line region. We apply our latest slow shock models for gas shocked by galactic-scale winds. We show that at high redshift, galactic wind shocks are clearly separated from AGN in line ratio space. Instead, shocks from galactic winds mimic high metallicity starburst galaxies. We discuss our models in the context of future large near-infrared spectroscopic surveys.",

      "abstract": "We provide a multiwavelength census of dwarf Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the volume- and mass-limited RESOLVE and ECO surveys using mid-IR colours, the BPT diagnostic plot with both traditional and alternative demarcations from literature, and our new multi-diagnostic approach revealing the previously overlooked \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN). Emission line flux ratios of SF-AGN position them as star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram but as AGN in at least one of two other diagnostic plots using [OI]/H\u03b1 or [SII]/H\u03b1 instead of the metallicity-sensitive [NII]/H\u03b1 used in the BPT diagram. SF-AGN are common in local dwarf galaxies, and photoionization models confirm their line ratio patterns match those of model low-metallicity, highly star-forming dwarf galaxies with active intermediate-mass black holes. Given the statistically complete nature of these surveys down to baryonic (stellar+gas) masses of ~10<SUP>9.2</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, they give us the opportunity to quote full-population AGN statistics previously unavailable in the dwarf regime. The addition of SF-AGN and bonus AGN from the alternative BPT plot quadruples the optical dwarf AGN percentage from ~1% to ~4% of the full galaxy population (including non-emission line galaxies). Mid-IR colours also identify up to ~4% of all dwarfs as AGN, albeit the status of the mid-IR AGN candidates is less secure than the optical AGN. We find little overlap between methods, hinting at the possibility that they identify AGN hosts at different evolutionary stages. The bonus dwarf AGN from the alternative BPT method mostly have relatively high metallicity and low star formation activity for dwarfs. In contrast, the mid-IR and SF-AGN hosts have more typical metallicities and star formation rates. Assuming all AGN candidates to be valid, the combined multiwavelength z~0 dwarf AGN frequency is ~5-8%, implying that active accretion onto intermediate mass BHs in dwarf galaxies may be more widespread than previously realised, with implications for BH-galaxy coevolution. We further investigate the properties and environments of SF-AGN and their hosts.",

We compare [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [S II]/(H\u03b1 + [N II]) as an \"unVO87\" diagram for 461 galaxies and [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [Ne III]/[O II] as an \"OHNO\" diagram for 91 galaxies. The unVO87 diagram does not effectively separate active galactic nuclei (AGN) and [Ne V] sources from star-forming galaxies, indicating that the unVO87 properties of star-forming galaxies evolve with redshift and overlap with AGN emission-line signatures at z &gt; 1. The OHNO diagram does effectively separate X-ray AGN and [Ne V]-emitting galaxies from the rest of the population. We find that the [O III]/H\u03b2 line ratios are significantly anticorrelated with stellar mass and significantly correlated with $\\mathrm{log}({L}_{{\\rm{H}}\\beta })$ , while [S II]/(H\u03b1 + [N II]) is significantly anticorrelated with $\\mathrm{log}({L}_{{\\rm{H}}\\beta })$ . Comparison with MAPPINGS V photoionization models indicates that these trends are consistent with lower metallicity and higher ionization in low-mass and high-star formation rate (SFR) galaxies. We do not find evidence for redshift evolution of the emission-line ratios outside of the correlations with mass and SFR. Our results suggest that the OHNO diagram of [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [Ne III]/[O II] will be a useful indicator of AGN content and gas conditions in very high-redshift galaxies to be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.",

We use our observations to revise the traditional emission-line diagnostic classifications so that they reliably identify distinct dynamical samples both in two-dimensional representations of the diagnostic line ratio space and in a multidimensional space that accounts for the complex folding of the star-forming model surface. By comparing the MaNGA observations to the SDSS single-fiber galaxy sample, we note that the latter is systematically biased against young, low-metallicity star-forming regions that lie outside of the 3\u2033 fiber footprint.",

      "title": "Alternative diagnostic diagrams and the `forgotten' population of weak line galaxies in the SDSS",
      "abstract": "A numerous population of weak line galaxies (WLGs) is often left out of statistical studies on emission-line galaxies (ELGs) due to the absence of an adequate classification scheme, since classical diagnostic diagrams, such as [OIII]/H\u03b2 versus [NII]/H\u03b1 (the BPT diagram), require the measurement of at least four emission lines. This paper aims to remedy this situation by transposing the usual divisory lines between star-forming (SF) galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosts and between Seyferts and LINERs to diagrams that are more economical in terms of line quality requirements. By doing this, we rescue from the classification limbo a substantial number of sources and modify the global census of ELGs. More specifically, (1) we use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 to constitute a suitable sample of 280000 ELGs, one-third of which are WLGs. (2) Galaxies with strong emission lines are classified using the widely applied criteria of Kewley et al., Kauffmann et al. and Stasi\u0144ska et al. to distinguish SF galaxies and AGN hosts and Kewley et al. to distinguish Seyferts from LINERs. (3) We transpose these classification schemes to alternative diagrams keeping [NII]/H\u03b1 as a horizontal axis, but replacing H\u03b2 by a stronger line (H\u03b1 or [OII]), or substituting the ionization-level sensitive [OIII]/H\u03b2 ratio with the equivalent width of H\u03b1 (W<SUB>H\u03b1</SUB>). Optimized equations for the transposed divisory lines are provided. (4) We show that nothing significant is lost in the translation, but that the new diagrams allow one to classify up to 50 per cent more ELGs. (5) Introducing WLGs in the census of galaxies in the local Universe increases the proportion of metal-rich SF galaxies and especially LINERs. <P />In the course of this analysis, we were led to make the following points. (i) The Kewley et al. BPT line for galaxy classification is generally ill-used. (ii) Replacing [OIII]/H\u03b2 by W<SUB>H\u03b1</SUB> in the classification introduces a change in the philosophy of the distinction between LINERs and Seyferts, but not in its results. Because the W<SUB>H\u03b1</SUB> versus [NII]/H\u03b1 diagram can be applied to the largest sample of ELGs without loss of discriminating power between Seyferts and LINERs, we recommend its use in further studies. (iii) The dichotomy between Seyferts and LINERs is washed out by WLGs in the BPT plane, but it subsists in other diagnostic diagrams. This suggests that the right wing in the BPT diagram is indeed populated by at least two classes, tentatively identified with bona fide AGN and `retired' galaxies that have stopped forming stars and are ionized by their old stellar populations.",

We find the following: (1) the luminosities of all measured narrow lines (H\u03b1, H\u03b2, [O III], [N II], [S II], [O I]) show a Baldwin relation relative to the broad H\u03b1 luminosity L<SUB>bH\u03b1</SUB>, with slopes in the range of 0.53-0.72. (2) About 20 per cent of the type 1 AGN reside within the `Composite' and `star-forming' (SF) regions of the Baldwin, Phillips &amp; Terlevich (BPT) diagrams. These objects also show excess narrow H\u03b1 and ultraviolet (UV) luminosities, for their L<SUB>bH\u03b1</SUB>, consistent with contribution from star formation which dominates the narrow-lines emission, as expected from their positions in the BPT diagrams. (3) The type 1 which reside within the AGN region in the BPT diagrams, are offset to lower [S II]/H\u03b1 and [N II]/H\u03b1 luminosity ratios, compared to type 2 AGN. This offset is a selection effect, related to the lower AGN/host luminosity selection of the type 2 AGN selected from the SDSS galaxy sample. (4) The [N II]/H\u03b1 and [N II]/[S II] ratios in type 1 AGN increase with the host mass, as expected if the mass-metallicity relation of quiescent galaxies holds for the AGN narrow-line region (NLR). (5) The broad lines optical Fe II is higher for a higher [N II]/H\u03b1, at a fixed L<SUB>bol</SUB> and Eddington ratio L/L<SUB>Edd</SUB>. This suggests that the broad line region metallicity is also related to the host mass. (6) The fraction of AGN which are low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) increases sharply with decreasing L/L<SUB>Edd</SUB>. This fraction is the same for type 1 and type 2 AGN.

However, the shift for our rest-frame optically selected sample is less significant than for rest-frame-UV selected and emission-line selected galaxies at z \u223c 2.
