  "title": "RESOLVE and ECO: Finding Low-metallicity z   0 Dwarf AGN Candidates Using Optimized Emission-line Diagnostics",
  "abstract": "Existing star-forming vs. active galactic nucleus (AGN) classification schemes using optical emission-line diagnostics mostly fail for low-metallicity and/or highly star-forming galaxies, missing AGN in typical z ~ 0 dwarfs. To recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey emission-line catalogs overlapping the volume- and mass-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntex (ECO) surveys to determine the AGN percentage in SEL dwarfs. Our photoionization grids show that the [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [S II]/H\u03b1 diagram (S II plot) and [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [O I]/H\u03b1 diagram (O I plot) are less metallicity sensitive and more successful in identifying dwarf AGN than the popular [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [N II]/H\u03b1 diagnostic (N II plot or \"BPT diagram\"). We identify a new category of \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN) classified as star-forming by the N II plot but as AGN by the S II and/or O I plots. Including SF-AGN, we find the z ~ 0 AGN percentage in dwarfs with SELs to be ~3%-16%, far exceeding most previous optical estimates (~1%). The large range in our dwarf AGN percentage reflects differences in spectral fitting methodologies between catalogs. The highly complete nature of RESOLVE and ECO allows us to normalize strong emission-line galaxy statistics to the full galaxy population, reducing the dwarf AGN percentage to ~0.6%-3.0%. The newly identified SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs with halo mass &lt;10<SUP>11.5</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>, where highly efficient cosmic gas accretion is expected. Almost all SF-AGN also have low metallicities (Z \u2272 0.4 Z <SUB>\u2299</SUB>), demonstrating the advantage of our method.",

      "abstract": "The finding of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies has important implications for galaxy evolution and supermassive black hole formation models. Yet, how AGNs in dwarf galaxies form is still debated, in part due to scant demographics. We use the MaNGA survey, comprising ~10 000 galaxies at z &lt; 0.15, to identify AGN dwarf galaxies using a spaxel-by-spaxel classification in three spatially-resolved emission-line diagnostic diagrams (the [N II]-, [S II]-, and [O I]-BPT) and the WHAN diagram. This yields a sample of 664 AGN dwarf galaxies, the largest to date, and an AGN fraction of $\\sim 20~{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$ that is significantly larger than that of single-fibre-spectroscopy studies (i.e. $\\sim 1~{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$). This can be explained by the lower bolometric luminosity (&lt;10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and accretion rate (sub-Eddington) of the MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies. We additionally identify 1176 SF-AGNs (classified as star-forming in the [N II]-BPT but as AGNs in the [S II]- and [O I]-BPT), 122 Composite, and 173 LINER sources. The offset between the optical centre of the galaxy and the median position of the AGN spaxels is more than 3 arcsec for ~62% of the AGNs, suggesting that some could be off-nuclear. We also identify seven new broad-line AGNs with log M<SUB>BH</SUB> = 5.0-5.9 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. Our results show how integral-field spectroscopy is a powerful tool for uncovering faint and low-accretion AGNs and better constraining the demographics of AGNs in dwarf galaxies.",

      "abstract": "Using early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we search for active galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures in 410,757 line-emitting galaxies. By employing the BPT emission-line ratio diagnostic diagram, we identify AGNs in 75,928/296,261 (\u224825.6%) high-mass (<inline-formula> </inline-formula> 9.5) and 2444/114,496 (\u22482.1%) dwarf (<inline-formula> </inline-formula> 9.5) galaxies.

X-ray AGNs are selected from deep XMM observations using a new method that results in greater samples with a wider range of X-ray luminosities, complete to {log}({L}<SUB>{{X</SUB>}})&gt; 41 for z &lt; 0.3. Taking X-ray detectability into account, we find that the average fraction of X-ray AGNs in the BPT star-forming branch is 2%, suggesting the BPT diagram can provide a reasonably clean sample of star-forming galaxies. However, the X-ray selection is itself rather incomplete. At the tip of the AGN branch of the BPT diagram, the X-ray AGN fraction is only 14%, which may have implications for studies that exclude AGNs based only on X-ray observations. Interestingly, the X-ray AGN fractions are similar for Seyfert and LINER populations, consistent with LINERs being true AGNs. We find that neither the star formation dilution nor the hidden broad-line components can satisfactorily explain the apparent misclassification of X-ray AGNs. On the other hand, \u223c40% of all X-ray AGNs have weak emission lines such that they cannot be placed on the BPT diagram at all and often have low specific SFRs. Therefore, the most likely explanation for \u201cmisclassified\u201d X-ray AGNs is that they have intrinsically weak AGN lines, and are only placeable on the BPT diagram when they tend to have high specific SFRs.",

We selected the AGN using the classical BPT diagram, a similar optical emission line diagnostic based on the He II \u03bb4686 line, and mid-IR colour cuts. Different criteria select host galaxies with different physical properties such as stellar mass and optical colour and only 3 out of 336 sources fulfil all three criteria. This could be in part due to selection biases. The resulting AGN fraction of \u223c0.7 per cent is at least one order of magnitude below the one estimated for more massive galaxies. At optical wavelengths, the He II-based AGN selection appears to be more sensitive to AGN hosted in star-forming galaxies than the classical BPT diagram, at least in the low-mass regime. The archival X-ray and radio data available for some of the AGN candidates seem to confirm their AGN nature, but follow-up observations are needed to confirm the AGN nature of the rest of the sample, especially in the case of mid-IR selection. Our sample will be important for future follow-up studies aiming to understand the relation between BHs and host galaxies in the low-mass regime.",

We measure emission line strengths as a function of radius and place galaxies on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. Remarkably, 16 of 20 quiescent galaxies in our sample host central active galactic nucleus (AGN)-like line ratios. Only five of these quiescent galaxies were identified as AGN-like in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey due to a lower spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We find that many of the quiescent galaxies in our sample have spatially extended emission across the non-star-forming regions of BPT-space. While quenched galaxies in denser environments in this mass range often show no evidence for AGN activity, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies in isolation host AGNs despite their overall passive appearances.",

      "abstract": "Current emission-line-based estimates of the metallicity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at both high and low redshifts indicate that AGN have predominantly solar-to-supersolar metallicities. This leads to the question: do low-metallicity AGN exist? In this paper, we use photoionization models to examine the effects of metallicity variations on the narrow emission-lines from an AGN. We explore a variety of emission-line diagnostics that are useful for identifying AGN with low-metallicity gas. We find that line ratios involving [NII] are the most robust metallicity indicators in galaxies where the primary source of ionization is from the active nucleus. Ratios involving [SII] and [OI] are strongly affected by uncertainties in modelling the density structure of the narrow-line clouds. To test our diagnostics, we turn to an analysis of AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a clear trend in the relative strength of [NII] with the mass of the AGN-host galaxy. The metallicity of the ISM is known to be correlated with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies; our results indicate that a similar trend exists for AGN. We also find that the best-fitting models for typical Seyfert narrow-line regions (NLRs) have supersolar abundances. Although there is a mass-dependent range of a factor of 2-3 in the NLR metallicities of the AGN in our sample, AGN with subsolar metallicities are very rare in the SDSS. Out of a sample of ~23000 Seyfert 2 galaxies, we find only ~40 clear candidates for AGN with NLR abundances that are below solar.",

These models span a wide range of physical parameters including metallicity, ionization parameter, and the adoption of both an instantaneous burst and continuous star formation history (SFH). We examine the agreement between our models and local (z &lt; 0.1) star-forming galaxy populations from several large data sets, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey, and samples of blue compact galaxies and metal-poor galaxies. We find that models adopting a continuous SFH reproduce the metallicity-sensitive line ratios observed in the local population of star-forming galaxies, including the low-metallicity sample. However, we find that the current codes generate an insufficiently hard ionizing radiation field, leading to deficiencies in the [S II] fluxes produced by the models. We consider the advantages and shortcomings of this suite of models, and discuss future work and improvements that can be applied to the modeling of star-forming galaxies.",

We find tentative evidence for steeper far-UV spectral slopes in lower-mass systems. Overall, NLR emission lines in these low-mass AGNs exhibit trends similar to those seen in AGNs with higher-mass BHs, such as increasing blueshifts and broadening with increasing ionization potential. Additionally, we see evidence of an intermediate-line region whose intensity correlates with L/L <SUB>Edd</SUB>, as seen in higher-mass AGNs. We highlight the interesting trend that, at least in these low-mass AGNs, the [O III] equivalent width (EW) is highest in symmetric NLR lines with no blue wing.
