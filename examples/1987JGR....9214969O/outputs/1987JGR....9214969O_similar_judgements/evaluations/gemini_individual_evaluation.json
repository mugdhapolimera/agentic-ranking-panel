      "explanation": "This paper discusses the discovery of a ring interior to Uranus' known rings and derives a typical anisotropy factor for the scattering behavior of the particles. This relates to the main paper's discussion of the photometric properties and scattering behavior of Uranian rings, though it does not focus specifically on Voyager 2 data."

    "2": {
      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "This paper is about Saturn's A ring. It has no relevance to the main paper, which is about Uranian rings."

    "4": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This paper is a general overview of the Voyager 2 imaging science results in the Uranian system, including confirming the low albedo of the ring particles. It's relevant because it discusses Voyager 2 observations of the Uranian rings, as does the main paper."
    },
    "5": {
      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "This paper is about Saturn's rings. It has no relevance to the main paper, which is about Uranian rings."
    },
    "6": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This paper directly relates to the main paper. It presents measurements of the brightness variation of several Uranian rings using Voyager data, and determines the single scattering albedo of the ring particles. This aligns perfectly with the main paper's focus on Uranian ring photometry using Voyager 2 data."
    },
    "7": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This paper presents photometric properties of Uranian satellites and rings based on Hubble Space Telescope images. It's relevant because it discusses the photometry of Uranian rings, though it uses HST data rather than Voyager 2 data. It also mentions albedo measurements, which are part of the main paper."
    },
    "8": {
      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "This paper is a critical assessment of the Hapke photometric model in general. It has no specific relation to Uranian rings or Voyager data."

      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "This paper is about photometry and polarimetry of Titan. It has no relevance to the main paper, which is about Uranian rings."

      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "This paper discusses Voyager disk resolved photometry of the Saturnian satellites. It has no relevance to the main paper, which is about Uranian rings."

    "14": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This paper examines Uranus' \u03b6 ring in Voyager 2 wide-angle camera observations, quantifying the ring's structure in 1986 and its modifications prior to 2007. It's relevant because it deals with Voyager 2 observations and photometry of a Uranian ring, although it focuses on the \u03b6 ring rather than the main rings."

      "explanation": "This paper is about Galileo Photometry of Asteroid 951 Gaspra. It has no relevance to the main paper, which is about Uranian rings."

    "suggestions": [
      "Refine the search query to specifically target 'Uranian rings' and 'Voyager 2'.",
