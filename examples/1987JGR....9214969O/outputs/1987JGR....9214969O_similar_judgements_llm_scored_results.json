  "title": "Uranian ring photometry: Results from Voyager 2",
  "abstract": "We have investigated seven images of the Uranian rings taken with the clear filter of the Voyager 2 cameras during the January 1986 encounter. The images are at phase angles of 15.5\u00b0, 21.0\u00b0, 89,5\u00b0, and 172.5\u00b0. We obtained an average reflectivity (I/F) for each of the nine main rings (6,5,4,\u03b1,\u03b2,\u025b,\u03b3,\u03b4, and \u025b) at each phase angle. We compared the observed phase angle variation of I/F with model calculations for various combinations of macroscopic (backscattering) and microscopic (forward scattering) particles. The phase angle variation of I/F for all of the main rings is dominated by backscattering. The phase functions for the ring particles resemble that of the Moon; however, the observed phase functions decrease more rapidly between 21.0\u00b0 and 15.5\u00b0 than predicted by the lunar phase function. We obtained a single-scattering or Bond albedo for the large particles using the best fit backscatter phase function. The average Bond albedo of the particles for all the rings was 0.014+/-0.004. The shape of the phase variation of I/F around 172.5\u00b0 phase angle was used to constrain the size distribution of the microscopic ``dust-sized'' particles. The fractional area in dust-sized particles in and around the main rings did not exceed 2\u00d710<SUP>-</SUP><SUP>3</SUP>. The observations are consistent with an average dust particle size of 1.0+/-0.3 \u03bcm in a Hansen-Hovenier distribution and with a power law distribution for spherical particles with spectral index (p)=2.5+/-0.5. The phase function of 1986U1R was not modeled, because of an anomalous azimuthal darkening in the highest phase angle image that could be due to structural variation.",

      "abstract": "We present high quality images of the uranian ring system, obtained in August 2002, October 2003, and July 2004 at 2.2 \u03bcm with the adaptive optics camera NIRC2 on the Keck II telescope. Using these data, we report the first detection in backscattered light of a ring (which we refer to as the \u03b6 ring) interior to Uranus' known rings. This ring consists of a generally uniform sheet of dust between 37,850 and 41,350 km with an equivalent width EW=250\u00b120m (in 2004; or \u03bcEW\u224850m), and extends inward to 32,600 km at a gradually decreasing brightness. This ring might be related to the Voyager ring R/1986 U 2, although both its location and extent differ. This could be attributed to a difference in observing wavelength and/or solar phase angle, or perhaps to temporal variations in the ring. Through careful modeling of the I/F of the individual rings at each ansa, we reveal the presence of narrow (few 100 km wide) sheets of dust between the \u03b4 and \u025b rings, and between rings 4 and \u03b1. We derived a typical anisotropy factor g\u22480.7 in the scattering behavior of these particles. The spatial distribution and relative intensity of these dust sheets is different than that seen in Voyager images taken in forward scattered light, due either to a difference in observing wavelength, and/or solar phase angle or to changes over time. We may have detected the \u03bb ring in one scan at \u03bcEW\u224815m, but other scans provided upper limits below this value. A single detection, however, would be consistent with azimuthal asymmetries known to exist in this ring. We further demonstrate the presence of azimuthal asymmetries in all rings. We confirm the eccentricity of \u223c0.001 in rings 4, 5, 6, which in 2004 are \u223c70 km closer to Uranus in the north (near periapse; lower I/F) than in the south. We find a global optical depth of \u03c4\u223c0.3 in the main rings, and of \u03c4=0.25\u00b10.05 in the \u025b ring.",

      "abstract": "Saturn's A Ring samples a wide range of dynamical environments, from the relatively unperturbed, optically thick inner region to the outer part of the ring, which contains numerous density waves. We analyze Voyager images of the A Ring to determine how the reflectivity of different radial regions varies with lighting and viewing geometry. We model our data with a classical radiative transfer code that includes the illumination of the rings by the Sun and Saturn. The particles in the inner and mid-A Ring have Bond albedos near 0.5 and are more backscattering than satellites of comparable albedo. The region outside the Encke Gap becomes progressively less backscattering with increasing radius. Particle properties change abruptly outside the Keeler Gap; particles here have an albedo near 0.6 and a Lambert-like phase function. In contrast with previous suggestions, the abundance of free, submicrometer \"dust\" is small throughout the entire A Ring; this conclusion holds even in the outermost A Ring, which is strongly perturbed by density waves. Models derived from low-phase data, assuming only macroscopic particles, correctly predict the high- phase reflectivity of the outer A Ring and individual strong density waves in the mid-A Ring. However, the inner and mid-A Ring are typically darker at high phase by a factor of two than our models predict. This discrepancy may be due to the reduced multiple scattering from a layer in which the particles are more closely packed. We have also studied the quadrupole azimuthal brightness asymmetry of the A Ring. The asymmetry has a full amplitude of 35% in the mid-A Ring in low-phase Voyager 2 images. We present results on its behavior and possible implications for the structure of the rings. Finally, we compare our results with studies using other data sets to synthesize our current understanding of the nature of the A Ring.",

      "abstract": "As part of a long-term study of Saturn's rings, we have used the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC2) to obtain several hundred high resolution images from 1996 to 2004, spanning the full range of ring tilt and solar phase angles accessible from the Earth. Using these multiwavelength observations and HST archival data, we have measured the photometric properties of spokes in the B ring, visible in a substantial number of images. We determined the spoke particle size distribution by fitting the wavelength-dependent extinction efficiency of a prominent, isolated spoke, using a Mie scattering model. Following Doyle and Gr\u00fcn (1990, Icarus 85, 168-190), we assumed that the spoke particles were sub-micron size spheres of pure water ice, with a Hansen-Hovenier size distribution (Hansen and Hovenier, 1974, J. Atmos. Sci. 31, 1137-1160). The WFPC2 wavelength coverage is broader than that of the Voyager data, resulting in tighter constraints on the nature of spoke particles. The effective particle size was r=0.57\u00b10.05 \u03bcm, and the size distribution was quite narrow with a variance of b=0.09\u00b10.03, very similar to the results of Doyle and Gr\u00fcn (1990, Icarus 85, 168-190), and consistent with predictions of plasma cloud models for spoke production from meteoritic impacts (Goertz and Morfill, 1983, Icarus 53, 219-229; Goertz, 1984, Adv. Space Res. 4, 137-141). In all, we identified 36 spokes or spoke complexes, predominantly on the morning (east) ansa. The photometric contrast of the spokes is strongly dependent on effective ring opening angle, B. Spokes were clearly visible on the north face of the rings in 1994, just prior to the most recent ring plane crossing (RPX) epoch, and on the south face shortly after RPX. However, spokes were both less abundant and fainter as the rings opened up, and no spokes were detected after 18 October 1998 ( B=-15.43\u00b0), when a single faint spoke was seen on the morning ansa. The high resolution and photometric quality of the WFPC2 images enabled us to set a detection limit of \u2a7d1% in fractional brightness contrast for spokes for the post-1998 observations. We compare the observed trend of spoke contrast with B to radiative transfer calculations based on three models of the distribution of spoke material. In the first, the spoke \"haze\" is uniformly mixed with macroscopic B ring particles. No variation in spoke contrast is predicted for single-scattering, in this case, and only a modest decrease in contrast with B is predicted when multiple scattering is taken into account. In the second model, the spoke dust occupies an extended layer that is thicker than the B ring, which gives virtually identical results to a third case, when the haze layer lies exclusively above the ring. Multiple-scattering Monte Carlo calculations for these two extended haze models match the trend of spoke contrast exceptionally well. We compute the predicted spoke contrast for a wide variety of viewing geometries, including forward- and backscattering. Based on these results, spokes should be easily detectable during the Cassini mission when the rings are viewed at relatively small ( |B|\u2a7d10\u00b0) ring opening angles.",

      "abstract": "Voyager 2 images of the southern hemisphere of Uranus indicate that submicrometersize haze particles and particles of a methane condensation cloud produce faint patterns in the atmosphere. The alignment of the cloud bands is similar to that of bands on Jupiter and Saturn, but the zonal winds are nearly opposite. At mid-latitudes (-70 degrees to -27 degrees), where winds were measured, the atmosphere rotates faster than the magnetic field; however, the rotation rate of the atmosphere decreases toward the equator, so that the two probably corotate at about -20 degrees. Voyager images confirm the extremely low albedo of the ring particles. High phase angle images reveal on the order of 10 <SUP>2</SUP> new ringlike features of very low optical depth and relatively high dust abundance interspersed within the main rings, as well as a broad, diffuse, low optical depth ring just inside the main ring system. Nine of the newly discovered small satellites (40 to 165 kilometers in diameter) orbit between the rings and Miranda; the tenth is within the ring system. Two of these small objects may gravitationally confine the \u025b ring. Oberon and Umbriel have heavily cratered surfaces resembling the ancient cratered highlands of Earth's moon, although Umbriel is almost completely covered with uniform dark material, which perhaps indicates some ongoing process. Titania and Ariel show crater populations different from those on Oberon and Umbriel; these were probably generated by collisions with debris confined to their orbits. Titania and Ariel also show many extensional fault systems; Ariel shows strong evidence for the presence of extrusive material. About half of Miranda's surface is relatively bland, old, cratered terrain. The remainder comprises three large regions of younger terrain, each rectangular to ovoid in plan, that display complex sets of parallel and intersecting scarps and ridges as well as numerous outcrops of bright and dark materials, perhaps suggesting some exotic composition.",

      "abstract": "Voyager 1 and 2 images of Saturn's rings are analyzed in independent studies of two different aspects of the rings. First, the light scattering behavior of the C Ring particles is examined using a classical radiative transfer analysis of radically resolved image data from both spacecraft. Double scattering and saturnshine are included as corrections to the observed I/F, and then the single scattering solution to the radiative transfer equation is inverted to produce the albedo-phase function product at each radius. We iterate to produce an average single particle phase function, which displays finite forward scattering that may be due either to surface roughness effects or to an unmodeled dust population. Slightly different phase functions are found for three distinct ring environments: the variegated inner C Ring, the high-optical depth plateau regions in the outer C Ring, and the low-optical depth \"background\" extending through the middle C Ring and between the plateaux. We also find that the single scattering albedo increases strongly outward in the C Ring. Each of these three average phase functions is then interpreted as a disk-integrated phase curve like those obtained for satellites and asteroids. The ring particles' surface structure is studied using a Hapke radiative transfer approach modeling the effects of macroscopic surface roughness and individual grain scattering properties. The second major component of this thesis is a study of the Keeler Gap, whose inner edge exhibits a strong (amplitude ~4-6km) radial variation. Gap widths are measured from aximuthally averaged radial scans of I/F, and fit to sine curves. We find a basically bimodal distribution in the fitted wavelength of the oscillation among different image sets, centered on ~ 7^circ and ~12^circ. We consider the effects of embedded satellites and of resonances with external satellites as possible contributors to the observed structure. The strongest resonance in the region, the 32:31 inner Lindblad resonance with the satellite Prometheus, may account for a subset of the observed waves (for data taken near a common time, ~1.2 days before Voyager 2 encounter); a combination of dynamical processes, however, is probably required to account for the variable wavelength.",

We have made careful measurements of the brightness variation as a function of longitude for the \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u025b rings. The measurements showed a substantial variation in azimuthal brightness because of the varying width of the rings. The single scattering albedo of the \u025b ring particles was found to be 3.9%+/-0.6% (for the Lambert surface) or 2.3%+/-0.4% assuming the ``lunar-type'' phase function. The optical depth at apoapse of the \u025b ring was found to be 0.40+/-0.05. Note that this determination of the optical depth is independent of the occultation measurement from Earth or from the spacecraft. This value is the optical depth for reflected light, whereas occultation data provide the forward scattering optical depth. It is consistent with varying amounts of mutual shadowing of ring particles due to changing width of the ring along its orbit.

      "abstract": "The photometric model developed by Hapke is commonly used to study surface structure and composition of atmosphereless celestial bodies using photometric measurements. However, this model has shortcomings that weaken its applications. For instance, some of the model parameters are empirical and mutually dependent. Moreover, the photometric model is eclectic and approximate; e.g., (1) the model simultaneously considers the single-scattering phase-function as backscattering and isotropic when describing, respectively, incoherent and coherent multiple scattering, which is physically impossible; (2) the approximation of the incoherent multiple scattering function takes into account the function anisotropy for the incident and emergent angles, but ignores the anisotropy for the azimuth angle that is of equal importance; (3) the model also ignores the dependence of the shadow-hiding effect of particles and coherent-backscattering enhancement on illuminating/viewing geometry, accounting only for the phase-angle component; (4) the azimuthal dependence of the shadow-hiding effect on random topographies is introduced ad hoc and is not verified; moreover, the shadow phase function may produce a non-physical maximum at large angles of viewing. We test the Hapke model using a computer simulation of ray-tracing in particulate surfaces, showing significant differences between the Hapke model and the ray-tracing results. We also apply the Hapke model to the interpretation of laboratory photometry of several well-characterized powdered samples measured in two wavelengths. The samples were measured in three states: as particles in air, as a particulate surface formed by freely spilled particles, and after compressing the particulate surface. The Hapke model parameters were completely inconsistent in the interpretation of these laboratory data. Our attempt to map the Hapke parameters using a series of telescopic calibrated images of the Moon acquired at different phase angles demonstrates that the model does not provide a physically meaningful distribution of its parameters. We also suggest that the small increase of the circular polarization ratio \u03bc<SUB>C</SUB> at decreasing phase angle (&lt;10\u00b0), which is observed for lunar samples, is not evidence of the coherent-backscattering effect of the Moon. We suggest that Clementine observations carried out with the UV-Vis and NIR cameras demonstrate that the coherent-backscattering effect exists only for bright lunar surface areas with albedo higher than 30%.",

At 28\u00b0 phase, Titan's reflectivity in blue light at southern latitudes is as much as 25% greater than that at northern latitudes, comparable to the values observed by Voyager 1 ( L. A. Sromovsky et al., 1981, Nature (London), 292, 698-702). In red light the reflectivity is constant to within a few percent for latitudes between 40\u00b0S and 60\u00b0N. Titan's phase coefficient between 22 and 96\u00b0 phase angle averages about 0.014 magnitudes/degree in both colors\u2014a value considerably greater than that observed at smaller phase from the Earth. Comparisons of the data with vertically homogeneous multiple-scattering models indicate that the single-scattering phase functions of the aerosols in both colors are rather flat at scattering angles between 80 and 150\u00b0 with a small peak at larger scattering (i.e., small phase) angles. The models indicate that the phase integral, q, for Titan in both red and blue light is about 1.66 \u00b1 0.1.

The single-scattering polarizations produced by the particles at 90\u00b0 scattering angle are quite large, &gt;85% in blue light and &gt;95% in red. A vertically homogeneous model in which the particles are assumed to scatter as spheres cannot simultaneously match the polarization observations in both colors for any refractive index. However, the observed polarizations are most sensitive to the particle properties near optical depth 1/2 in each color, and so models based on single scattering by spheres can be successful over a range of refractive indices if the size of the particles increases with depth and if the cross section of the particles increases sufficiently rapidly with decreasing wavelenght. For example, with n<SUB>r</SUB> = 1.70, the polarization (and the photometry) are reproduced reasonably well in both colors when the area-weighted average radous of the particles, \u03b1, is given by \u03b1 = (0.117 \u03bcm)( \u03c4<SUB>red</SUB>/0.5) <SUP>0.217</SUP>. While this model does not reproduce the large increase in brightness from 129 to 160\u00b0 phase observed by Voyager 1, the observed increase is determined by the properties of the particles in the top few hundredths of an optical depth. Thus the addition of a very thin layer of forward-scattering aerosols on top of the above model offers one way of satisfying both the Pioneer 11 and Voyager 1 observations. Of course, other models, using bimodal size distributions or scattering by nonspherical particles, may also be capable of reproducing these data.",

      "abstract": "Laboratory and in situ measurements show that scattering properties of natural nonspherical particles can be significantly different from those of volume-or surface-equivalent spheres, thus suggesting that Mie theory may not be suitable for interpreting satellite reflectance measurements for dustlike tropospheric aerosols. In this paper we use the rigorous T-matrix method to extensively compute light scattering by shape distributions of polydisperse, randomly oriented spheroids with refractive indices and size distributions representative of naturally occurring dust aerosols. Our calculations show that even after size and orientation averaging, a single spheroidal shape always produces a unique, shape-specific phase function distinctly different from those produced by other spheroidal shapes. However, phase functions averaged over a wide aspect-ratio distribution of prolate and oblate spheroids are smooth, featureless, and nearly flat at side-scattering angles and closely resemble those measured for natural soil and dust particles. Thus, although natural dust particles are, of course, not perfect spheroids, they are always mixtures of highly variable shapes, and their phase function can be adequately modeled using a wide aspect-ratio distribution of prolate and oblate spheroidal grains. Our comparisons of nonspherical versus projected-area-equivalent spherical particles show that spherical-nonspherical differences in the scattering phase function can be large and therefore can cause significant errors in the retrieved aerosol optical thickness if Mie theory is used to analyze reflectance measurements of nonspherical aerosols. On the other hand, the differences in the total optical cross sections, single-scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter of the phase function, and backscattered fraction are much smaller and in most cases do not exceed 10%. This may suggest that for a given aerosol optical thickness the influence of particle shape on the aerosol radiative forcing is negligibly small. Spherical-nonspherical differences in the extinction-to-backscatter ratio are very large and should be explicitly taken into account in inverting lidar measurements of dustlike aerosols.",

      "abstract": "We study the light-scattering behavior of Saturn's rings for the purpose of deducing the nature and distribution of the particles comprising them and the collisional and dynamical environments in which they reside. To this end, we have developed two complex numerical codes to apply to this objective. One is a geometric ray-tracing code that scatters rays from a light source at an arbitrary illumination angle into a computer-generated patch of ring particles of predetermined photometric properties and size distribution, and counts the rays that emerge into arbitrary viewing directions. The code accounts for singly and multiply scattered light as well as the illumination of the rings by the planet Saturn. We examine the light-scattering behavior of various realizations of particle distribution, ring thickness, and optical depth\u2014assuming macroscopic, backscattering particles with radii in the centimeter-to-meter range\u2014and have compared our experimental results with classical analytical single-scattering and numerical multiple-scattering calculations, and with Cassini images of Saturn's A and C rings. We can reproduce the classical photometric results when vertically thick particle distributions are used, and we find good agreement with the observations when physically thin particle distributions are used, that is, in regimes where classical theory fails. This work has allowed us to demonstrate that the particles in the low optical depth portion of the C ring reflect about 32% of the incident sunlight in a manner similar to that of the jovian moon, Callisto. Those orbiting beyond the Encke gap in Saturn's A ring are nearly twice as reflective, and are slightly more forward scattering than those in the C ring. The A ring vertical full thickness beyond the Encke gap is likely to be very thin, ~10 m. The thickness of the C ring is not discernible from this work. The optically thicker A and B rings are darker at high phase than classical calculations predict because they are so thin. We have also incorporated the capability to realistically simulate a patch of colliding, self-gravitating particles in Saturn's gravity field into a sophisticated N-body parallel tree code. This code can model dissipative collisions among several million particles with optional sliding friction. We have applied our light-scattering code to simulations of Saturn's A ring produced by this patch code in which gravitational wakes have been observed to form. We have demonstrated, as have others, that such wakes are the likely cause of the well-known azimuthal brightness asymmetry in Saturn's A ring. We match the asymmetry amplitude and shape, as observed primarily in low-solar-phase Voyager images, by assuming a velocity-dependent restitution law that yields a coefficient of restitution ~3.5 times lower at the velocity dispersions appropriate for the smallest particles in Saturn's rings than previously assumed; Cassini data are consistent with these results. We simultaneously find a particle albedo and phase function consistent with those deduced from photometric analyses of Cassini images taken on approach to Saturn. These results suggest that the ring particle collisions in Saturn's A ring are more lossy than previously expected, a result possibly due to particle surface roughness, a regolith, and/or a large degree of porosity, all of which would lower the coefficient of restitution.",

We have measured the ring's radially integrated brightness over a wide range of phase angles (7\u00b0 to 156\u00b0) from the Voyager images. Whenever possible, measurements have been repeated in multiple images over a wide range of longitudes in order to average out the ring's intrinsic brightness variations. To model the resultant phase curve we have devided the ring population into two regimes: dust, of size comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of light (0.5 \u03bcm), and larger bodies. We model the single scattering properties of the small particles using a semiempirical theory for scattering by randomly oriented, nonspherical particles; scattering by the large bodies is based on the photometric behavior of satellites. We apply a doubling algorithm to solve the multiple scattering problem and to include the contribution of Saturn-shine to the incident radiation field. The free parameters in our models include the power law index q of the dust size distribution and the fractional contribution f of the dust to the total optical depth. Least-squares fits of this model to the imaging phase curve yield q = 4.6 \u00b1 0.5 and \u2a0d \u2265 98% . Comparison of optical depth profiles across the F Ring at wavelengths of 0.264 \u03bcm, 3.6 cm, and 13 cm indicates that centimeter-sized particles are the dominant source of opacity in a core \u223c 1km wide, while the micrometer-sized dust dominates in a much wider \"envelope\" that extends inward from the core.

It is of scientific interest because its morphology changed significantly between the Voyager 2 encounter in 1986 and subsequent Earth-based observations around 2007. It is also of practical interest because some Uranus mission concepts have the spacecraft pass through the inner flank of this ring. Recent reexaminations of the Voyager 2 images have revealed additional information about this ring that provide a more complete picture of the ring's radial brightness profile and phase function. These data reveal that this ring's brightness varies with phase angle in a manner similar to other tenuous rings, consistent with it being composed primarily of submillimeter-sized particles. The total cross section of particles within this ring can also be estimated from these data, but translating that number into the actual risk to a spacecraft flying through this region depends on a number of model-dependent parameters. Fortunately, comparisons with Saturn's G and D rings allows the \u03b6 ring's particle number density to be compared with regions previously encountered by the Voyager and Cassini spacecraft. Finally, these data indicate that the observed changes in the \u03b6 ring's structure between 1986 and 2007 are primarily due to a substantial increase in the amount of dust at distances between 38,000 and 40,000 km from Uranus' center.",

J. 129, 2887-2901) to characterize the before and after full Moon radiance variation for a typical highlands site and a typical mare site. Focusing on the phase angle range 45\u00b0 &lt; \u03b1 &lt; 50\u00b0, we test two different physical models, macroscopic roughness and multiple scattering between regolith particles, for their ability to quantitatively reproduce the measured radiance difference. Our method for estimating the rms slope angle is unique and model-independent in the sense that the measured radiance factor I/ F at small incidence angles (high Sun) is used as an estimate of I/ F for zero roughness regolith. The roughness is determined from the change in I/ F at larger incidence angles. We determine the roughness for 23 wavelengths from 350 to 939 nm. There is no significant wavelength dependence. The average rms slope angle is 22.2\u00b0 \u00b1 1.3\u00b0 for the mare site and 34.1\u00b0 \u00b1 2.6\u00b0 for the highland site. These large slopes, which are similar to previous \"photometric roughness\" estimates, require that sub-mm scale \"micro-topography\" dominates roughness measurements based on photometry, consistent with the conclusions of Helfenstein and Shepard (Helfenstein, P., Shepard, M.K. [1999]. Icarus 141, 107-131). We then tested an alternative and very different model for the before and after full Moon I/ F variation: multiple scattering within a flat layer of realistic regolith particles. This model consists of a log normal size distribution of spheres that match the measured distribution of particles in a typical mature lunar soil 72141,1 (McKay, D.S., Fruland, R.M., Heiken, G.H. [1974]. Proc. Lunar Sci. Conf. 5, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 1 (5), 887-906). The model particles have a complex index of refraction 1.65-0.003 i, where 1.65 is typical of impact-generated lunar glasses. Of the four model parameters, three were fixed at values determined from Apollo lunar soils: the mean radius and width of the log normal size distribution and the real part of the refraction index. We used FORTRAN programs from Mishchenko et al. (Mishchenko, M.I., Dlugach, J.M., Yanovitskij, E.G., Zakharova, N.T. [1999]. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 63, 409-432; Mishchenko, M.I., Travis, L.D., Lacis, A.A. [2002]. Scattering, Absorption and Emission of Light by Small Particles. Cambridge Univ. Press, New York. &lt; http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/mmishchenko/books.html&gt;) to calculate the scattering matrix and solve the radiative transfer equation for I/ F. The mean single scattering albedo is \u03c9 = 0.808, the asymmetry parameter is &lt;cos \u0398&gt; = 0.77 and the phase function is very strongly peaked in both the forward and backward scattering directions. The fit to the observations for the highland site is excellent and multiply scattered photons contribute \u2a7e80% of I/ F. We conclude that either model, roughness or multiple scattering, can match the observations, but that the strongly anisotropic phase functions of realistic particles require rigorous calculation of many orders of scattering or spurious photometric roughness estimates are guaranteed. Our multiple scattering calculation is the first to combine: (1) a regolith model matched to the measured particle size distribution and index of refraction of the lunar soil, (2) a rigorous calculation of the particle phase function and solution of the radiative transfer equation, and (3) application to lunar photometry with absolute radiance calibration.",

The Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) recorded an observation of Jupiter's main ring during orbit C3 at wavelengths from 0.7 to 5.2 \u03bcm; a second observation was attempted during orbit E4. We analyze the high phase angle NIMS and SSI observations to constrain the size distribution of the main ring's micron-sized dust population. This portion of the population is best constrained at high phase angles, as the light scattering behavior of small dust grains dominates at these geometries and contributions from larger ring particles are negligible. High phase angle images of the main ring obtained by the Voyager spacecraft covered phase angles between 173.8\u00b0 and 176.9\u00b0 (Showalter et al., 1987, Icarus 69, 458-498). Galileo images extend this range up to 178.6\u00b0. We model the Galileo phase curve and the ring spectra from the C3 NIMS ring observation as the combination of two power law distributions. Our analysis of the main ring phase curve and the NIMS spectra suggests the size distribution of the smallest ring particles is a power law with an index of 2.0\u00b10.3 below a size of \u223c15 \u03bcm that transitions to a power law with an index of 5.0\u00b11.5 at larger sizes. This combined power law distribution, or \"broken power law\" distribution, yields a better fit to the NIMS data than do the power law distributions that have previously been fit to the Voyager imaging data (Showalter et al., 1987, Icarus 69, 458-498). The broken power law distribution reconciles the results of Showalter et al. (1987, Icarus 69, 458-498) and McMuldroch et al. (2000, Icarus 146, 1-11), who also analyzed the NIMS data, and can be considered as an obvious extension of a simple power law. This more complex size distribution could indicate that ring particle production rates and/or lifetimes vary with size and may relate to the physical processes that control their evolution. The significant near arm/far arm asymmetry reported elsewhere (see Showalter et al., 1987, Icarus 69, 458-498; Ockert-Bell et al., 1999, Icarus 138, 188-213) persists in the data even after the main ring is isolated in the SSI images. However, the sense of the asymmetry seen in Galileo images differs from that seen in Voyager images. We interpret this asymmetry as a broad-scale, azimuthal brightness variation. No consistent association with the magnetic field of Jupiter has been observed. It is possible that these longitudinal variations may be similar to the random brightness fluctuations observed in Saturn's F ring by Voyager (Smith et al., 1982, Science 215, 504-537) and during the 1995 ring plane crossings (Nicholson et al., 1996, Science 272, 509-515; Bosh and Rivkin, 1996, Science 272, 518-521; Poulet et al., 2000, Icarus 144, 135-148).

Among the new results we report are that Titania is slightly redder than the other satellites and that the phase coefficients have a color dependence, with the UV phase coefficient being larger. This \"phase reddening\" is not completely expected for a spectrally flat object: we suggest that the decreased importance of multiple scattering cannot be the entire explanation for more sharply peaked blue phase curves. The observations have been fit to the radiative transfer model of B.

The particle single scattering albedo, \u03ce<SUB>0</SUB> = 0.36 \u00b1 0.07, is significantly larger than for lunar materials, and the opposition surge amplitude, B<SUB>0</SUB> = 1.63 \u00b1 0.07, is correspondingly smaller. We determine a visual geometric albedo p<SUB>v</SUB> = 0.22 \u00b1 0.06 for Gaspra, in close agreement with p<SUB>v</SUB> = 0.22 \u00b1 0.03 estimated from Earth-based observations. Gaspra's phase integral is 0.47, and the bolometric Bond albedo is estimated to be 0.12 \u00b1 0.03. An albedo map derived by correcting Galileo images with our average global photometric function reveals subdued albedo contrasts of \u00b110% or less over Gaspra's northern hemisphere. Several independent classification algorithms confirm the subtle spectral heterogeneity reported earlier (S. Mottola, M. DiMartino, M. Gonano-Beurer, H. Hoffman, and G. Neukum, 1993, Asteroids, Comets, Meteors, pp. 421-424; M. J. S. Belton et al., 1992, Science 257, 1647-1652). Whole-disk colors (0.41 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 0.99 \u03bcm) vary systematically with longitude by about \u00b15%, but color differences as large as 30% occur locally. Colors vary continuously between end-member materials whose areal distribution correlates with regional topography. Infrared: violet (0.99:0.41-\u03bcm) color ratios on Gaspra are strongly correlated with local elevation, being largest at lower elevations and smaller at higher elevations. No correlation was detected between elevation and the green:violet (0.56:0.41-\u03bcm) color ratio. Bright materials with a strong 1-\u03bcm absorption occur primarily in association with craters along ridges, while darker materials with 30% weaker 1-\u03bcm signatures occur downslope. The variations of color and albedo cannot be easily explained by grain-size effects alone or by differences in photometric geometry. The trends observed are consistent with those revealed by laboratory studies of the effects of comminution, glass formation, and segregation of metal from silicate components in chondritic meteorites and also in some silicate mixtures. The relative importance of these various processes on Gaspra remains to be determined.",

      "abstract": "The photometric parameters of B. W. Hapke's (1986, Icarus 67, 264-280) equation are fit to the lunar disk-integrated visual lightcurve and to disk-resolved data of R. W. Shorthill, J. M. Saari, F. E. Baird, and J. R. LeCompte (1969, Photometric Properties of Selected Lunar Features, NASA Contractor Report CR-1429) for dark, average, and bright lunar terrains. The lunar nearside geometric albedo and phase integral computed from the disk-integrated results are consistent with those of earlier investigators. The single scattering albedos of disk-resolved average and bright lunar terrains are systematically larger than that of lunar mare. Average particles in dark terrain regoliths are more backscattering than those in average and bright lunar terrains. The angular width of the opposition surge is greatest in dark terrains and is found to be best explained by modest differences in regolith particle-size distributions which might accompany the normal regolith maturation process. The total amplitude of the opposition surge for dark terrains is larger than for average and bright terrains. This result appears to be a consequence of the fact that in opaque particles, a larger fraction of singly scattered light at zero phase comes from first-surface reflection. The average subcentimeter macroscopic roughness of dark terrains is significantly lower than that of average and bright terrains. The relative magnitude of this difference is consistent with that obtained from radar measurements at decimeter scales.",

      "abstract": "We have investigated the light scattering behavior of Saturn's outer B ring at the 0.49-\u03bcm wavelength of the Voyager imaging system's clear filter. We study four types of radial regions: relatively bright and dark areas within, and outside of, the \"spokes.\" We model our data with a classical radiative transfer code which considers the illumination of the rings by the Sun and by Saturn. We find that the B ring particles have a strongly backscattering phase function similar to that of the satellite Callisto, suggesting the presence of a regolith on the surface of the ring particles. The large particle (spherical) albedo is 0.54 in the dark B ring regions and 0.58 in the bright regions. We interpret these albedos as the result of multiple scattering among very pure ice grains which cover the surfaces of the ring particles. The B ring regious outside the spokes appear to contain very little free submicron \"dust,\" a result with important implication for theories of ring composition and evolution. In the spokes, the fractional dust optical depth is about 1-2%, considerably less than previously believed. The radii of the spoke particles themselves cannot be uniquely determined due to the limited high phase angle coverage available. Finally, we show that impacts of dark micrometeroids into the B ring should have darkened the particles to their present spherical albedo in only about 1-2 \u00d7 10 <SUP>8</SUP> years, and discuss this result in relation to other, previous arguments for a young ring age.",
