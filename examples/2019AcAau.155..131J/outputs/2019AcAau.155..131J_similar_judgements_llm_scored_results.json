  "abstract": "Observations of the collisional evolution of particle ensembles in a microgravity environment are necessary to characterize the processes that lead to the formation of planetesimals, km-size and larger bodies, within the protoplanetary disk. The two current theories of planetesimal formation, namely growth through binary sticking collisions and gravitational instability within the protoplanetary disk, have difficulties in explaining how particles grow beyond a centimeter in size. In this paper we describe the CubeSat Particle Aggregation and Collision Experiment (Q-PACE), a Low Earth Orbit 3U CubeSat mission that will provide a high-quality, long duration microgravity environment in which we will observe collisions between particles under conditions relevant to planetesimal formation. We have designed a series of experiments involving a broad range of particle size, density, surface properties, and collision velocities to observe collisional outcomes from bouncing to sticking as well as aggregate disruption in tens of thousands of collisions.",

      "abstract": "Context. The growth processes from protoplanetary dust to planetesimals are not fully understood. Laboratory experiments and theoretical models have shown that collisions among the dust aggregates can lead to sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation. However, no systematic study on the collisional outcome of protoplanetary dust has been performed so far, so that a physical model of the dust evolution in protoplanetary disks is still missing. <BR /> Aims: We intend to map the parameter space for the collisional interaction of arbitrarily porous dust aggregates. This parameter space encompasses the dust-aggregate masses, their porosities and the collision velocity. With such a complete mapping of the collisional outcomes of protoplanetary dust aggregates, it will be possible to follow the collisional evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disk environment. <BR /> Methods: We use literature data, perform laboratory experiments, and apply simple physical models to get a complete picture of the collisional interaction of protoplanetary dust aggregates. <BR /> Results: We found four different kinds of sticking, two kinds of bouncing, and three kinds of fragmentation as possible outcomes in collisions among protoplanetary dust aggregates. Our best collision model distinguishes between porous and compact dust. We also differentiate between collisions among similar-sized and different-sized bodies. All in all, eight combinations of porosity and mass ratio can be discerned. For each of these cases, we present a complete collision model for dust-aggregate masses between 10<SUP>-12</SUP> and 10<SUP>2</SUP> g and collision velocities in the range of 10<SUP>-4</SUP> ldots 10<SUP>4</SUP> cm s<SUP>-1</SUP> for arbitrary porosities. This model comprises the collisional outcome, the mass(es) of the resulting aggregate(s) and their porosities. <BR /> Conclusions: We present the first complete collision model for protoplanetary dust. This collision model can be used for the determination of the dust-growth rate in protoplanetary disks. <P />This paper is dedicated to the memory of our dear friend and colleague Frithjof Brauer (14th March 1980-19th September 2009) who developed powerful models of dust coagulation and fragmentation, and thereby studied the formation of planetesimals beyond the meter size barrier in his Ph.D. thesis.

      "abstract": "The processes that lead to growth from micron-sized dust grains to km-size bodies span orders of magnitude in particle size, velocity, and timescales, resulting in a complex problem that requires extensive modeling and experimental inputs. The long duration, high-quality microgravity environment provided by a CubeSat is the perfect platform to study the collisional evolution of particles in the size regime relevant to the first stages of planet formation. Q-PACE is a 3U CubeSat mission designed to produce tens of thousands of low-velocity (mm/s - cm/s) collisions between micron to cm-size particles. The large number of collisions will make it possible to provide a probabilistic description of collisional outcomes that can be used in planet formation models. The experiment consists of particles contained within a backlit experimental test chamber (ETC) within the CubeSat, a shaking mechanism to control the particle ensemble velocity distribution, a chamber to introduce new particles at different experiment phases, and an overhead camera to record collisions within the chamber. Experiments will be carried out in four phases: (1) collisions between 5 1-cm and 30 2-mm particles in the ETC; (2) addition of 30 mm-size chondrules to the ETC; (3) addition of 100-micron SiO<SUB>2</SUB> dust aggregates to the ETC; and (4) vigorous shaking of the ETC to disaggregate the dust aggregates and observe dust-coated particle interactions. To reproduce the anticipated results of these experiments we carried out simulations using the DEM granular mechanics software LIGGGHTS. The tunable parameters of our simulation include the particle number density and size distribution selected to reflect discrete experimental phases, the particle velocity distribution, and the cohesive properties of the particles. Through our simulations we identify formation timescales for clusters of varying sizes as well as the frequency of accretion, bouncing, and fragmentation events as a function of the tunable parameters. We present the results of our numerical simulations as well as the implications for interpreting future data produced by the Q-PACE mission.",

      "abstract": "The behavior of solid particles in a low-mass solar nebula during settling to the central plane and the formation of planetesimals is examined. Gravitational instability in a dust layer and collisional accretion are considered as possible mechanisms of planetesimal formation. Non-Keplerian rotation of the nebula results in shear between the gas and a dust layer. This shear produces turbulence within the layer which inhibits gravitational instability, unless the mean particle size exceeds a critical value, \u223c1 cm at 1 AU. The size requirement is less stringent at larger heliocentric distances, suggesting a possible difference in planetesimal formation mechanisms between the inner and outer nebula. Coagulation of grains during settling is expected in the solar nebula environment. Van der Waals forces appear adequate to produce centimeter-sized aggregates. Growth is primarily due to sweepup of small particles by larger ones due to size-dependent settling velocities. A numerical model for computing simultaneous coagulation and settling is described. Relative velocities are determined by gas drag and the non-Keplerian rotation of the nebula. The settling is very nonhomologous. Most of the solid matter reaches the central plane as centimeter-sized aggregates in a few times 10 <SUP>3</SUP> revolutions, but some remains suspended in the form of fine dust. Drag-induced relative velocities result in collisions. The growth of bodies in the central plane is initially rapid. After sizes reach \u223c10 <SUP>3</SUP> cm, relative velocities decrease and the growth rate declines. Gas drag rapidly damps the out-of-plane motions of these intermediate-sized bodies. They settle into a thin layer which is subject to gravitational instability. Kilometer-sized planetesimals are formed by this composite process.",

      "abstract": "Context. The coagulation of microscopic dust into planetesimals is the first step towards the formation of planets. The composition, size, and shape of the growing aggregates determine the efficiency of this early growth. In particular, it has been proposed that fluffy ice aggregates can grow very efficiently in protoplanetary disks, suffering less from the bouncing and radial drift barriers. <BR /> Aims: While the collision velocity between icy aggregates of similar size is thought to stay below the fragmentation threshold, they may nonetheless lose mass from collisions with much smaller projectiles. As a result, erosive collisions have the potential to terminate the growth of pre-planetesimal bodies. We investigate the effect of these erosive collisions on the ability of porous ice aggregates to cross the radial drift barrier. <BR /> Methods: We develop a Monte Carlo code that calculates the evolution of the masses and porosities of growing aggregates, while resolving the entire mass distribution at all times. The aggregate's porosity is treated independently of its mass, and is determined by collisional compaction, gas compaction, and eventually self-gravity compaction. We include erosive collisions and study the effect of the erosion threshold velocity on aggregate growth. <BR /> Results: For erosion threshold velocities of 20-40 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>, high-velocity collisions with small projectiles prevent the largest aggregates from growing when they start to drift. In these cases, our local simulations result in a steady-state distribution, with most of the dust mass in particles with Stokes numbers close to unity. Only for the highest erosion threshold considered (60 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>) do porous aggregates manage to cross the radial drift barrier in the inner 10 AU of MMSN-like disks. <BR /> Conclusions: Erosive collisions are more effective in limiting the growth than fragmentary collisions between similar-size particles. Conceivably, erosion limits the growth before the radial drift barrier, although the robustness of this statement depends on uncertain material properties of icy aggregates. If erosion inhibits planetesimal formation through direct sticking, the sea of ~10<SUP>9</SUP> g, highly porous particles appears suitable for triggering streaming instability.",

Once those aggregates have diameters exceeding a few centimetres, they become subject to concentration mechanisms such as the streaming instability, permitting the formation of self-gravitating clusters, which might eventually collapse into kilometre-sized planetesimals. However, for the streaming instability to set in, clumps spanning sizes from centimetres to decimetres are required in the centre of a protoplanetary disk. In the size range between millimetres and centimetres, aggregates bounce off each other rather than sticking together, and growth is stalled. Here we show in microgravity experiments that collisions between millimetre-sized grains lead to sufficient electrical charging for aggregation to bridge this gap between the bouncing barrier and the onset of the streaming instability. We computationally simulate aggregation and find that models agree with the experimental data only if electrical charging is present. We therefore propose that collisional charging may promote early growth in the size gap that current models of planetesimal formation cannot account for.",

This leads to the notion of a bouncing barrier for which growth gets stalled. Here, we present long-term laboratory experiments on the outcome of repeated aggregate collisions at the bouncing barrier. About 100 SiO<SUB>2</SUB> dust aggregates 1 mm in size were observed interacting with each other. Collisions occurred within a velocity range from below mm s<SUP>-1</SUP> up to cm s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Aggregates continuously interacted with each other over a period of 900 s. During this time, more than 10<SUP>5</SUP> collisions occurred. Nearly 2000 collisions were analyzed in detail. No temporal stable net growth of larger aggregates was observed even though sticking collision occurred. Larger ensembles of aggregates sticking together were formed but were disassembled again during further collisional evolution.

Their nuclei have low strength consistent with \u201crubble pile\u201d structure and inhomogeneities on scales of tens to hundreds of meters. These properties can be explained by their formation process in the solar nebula. <P />I present results of numerical simulation of the growth of cometesimals, beginning with a uniform mixture of microscopic grains in the nebular gas. Coagulation and settling yield a thin, dense layer of small aggregates in the central plane of the nebula. Shear between this layer and the pressure-supported gas produces turbulence that initially inhibits gravitational instability. Particles grow by collisional coagulation; relative velocities are dominated by radial motion due to orbital decay induced by gas drag. The radial velocity dispersion further delays gravitational instability until the mean particle size reaches tens of meters. Lack of damping in the swarm of macroscopic particles limits gravitational instability to large scales that do not allow collapse to solid bodies. Collisional coagulation is responsible for growth even after instability occurs. <P />The size distribution of cometesimals growing by drag-induced collisions develops a narrow peak in the range tens to hundreds of meters. This occurs because drag-induced velocities decrease with size in this range, while gravitational focusing is negligible. Impact velocities have a minimum at the transition from drag-driven to gravitational accretion at approximately kilometer sizes. Bodies accreted in this manner should have low mechanical strength and macroscopic voids in addition to small-scale porosity. They will be composed of structural elements having a variety of scales, but with some tendency for preferential sizes in the range \u223c10-100 m.

The key components describing this process are the relative velocity between the dust particles in this environment and the complex physics of dust aggregate collisions. <BR /> Aims: We present the results of a collision model based on laboratory experiments of these aggregates. We investigate the maximum aggregate size and mass that can be reached by coagulation in protoplanetary disks. <BR /> Methods: We use the results of laboratory experiments to establish the collision model previously published by G\u00fcttler et al. The collision model is based on the assumptions that we model the aggregates as spheres with compact and porous \"phases\" and that there is a continuous transition between these two. We apply this collision model to the Monte Carlo method developed previously by Zsom &amp; Dullemond and include Brownian motion, radial drift, and turbulence as contributors of relative velocity between dust particles. <BR /> Results: We model the growth of dust aggregates at 1 AU in the midplane for three different gas densities. We find that the evolution of the dust does not follow the previously assumed growth-fragmentation cycles. Catastrophic fragmentation hardly occurs in the three disk models. Furthermore, we see long-lived, quasi-steady states in the distribution function of the aggregates caused by bouncing. We explore how the mass and the porosity depend on both the turbulence parameter and the critical mass ratio of dust particles. Upon varying the turbulence parameter, the system behaves in a non-linear way, and we find that the critical mass ratio has a strong effect on the particle sizes and masses. Particles reach Stokes numbers of roughly 10<SUP>-4</SUP> during the simulations. <BR /> Conclusions: The particle growth is stopped by bouncing rather than fragmentation in these models. The final Stokes number of the aggregates is rather insensitive to the variations in the gas density and the strength of turbulence. The maximum mass of the particles is limited to \u22481 g (chondrule-sized particles).

The journey from dust particle to planetesimal involves physical processes acting on scales ranging from micrometers (the sticking and restructuring of aggregates) to hundreds of astronomical units (the size of the turbulent protoplanetary nebula). Considering these processes simultaneously is essential when studying planetesimal formation. <BR /> Aims: The goal of this work is to quantify where and when planetesimal formation can occur as the result of porous coagulation of icy grains and to understand how the process is influenced by the properties of the protoplanetary disk. <BR /> Methods: We develop a novel, global, semi-analytical model for the evolution of the mass-dominating dust particles in a turbulent protoplanetary disk that takes into account the evolution of the dust surface density while preserving the essential characteristics of the porous coagulation process. This panoptic model is used to study the growth from sub-micron to planetesimal sizes in disks around Sun-like stars. <BR /> Results: For highly porous ices, unaffected by collisional fragmentation and erosion, rapid growth to planetesimal sizes is possible in a zone stretching out to ~10 AU for massive disks. When porous coagulation is limited by erosive collisions, the formation of planetesimals through direct coagulation is not possible, but the creation of a large population of aggregates with Stokes numbers close to unity might trigger the streaming instability (SI). However, we find that reaching conditions necessary for SI is difficult and limited to dust-rich disks, (very) cold disks, or disks with weak turbulence. <BR /> Conclusions: Behind the snow-line, porosity-driven aggregation of icy grains results in rapid (~10<SUP>4</SUP> yr) formation of planetesimals. If erosive collisions prevent this, SI might be triggered for specific disk conditions.

      "abstract": "Accumulation of dust and ice particles into planetesimals is an important step in the planet formation process. Planetesimals are the seeds of both terrestrial planets and the solid cores of gas and ice giants forming by core accretion. Leftover planetesimals in the form of asteroids, transneptunian objects, and comets provide a unique record of the physical conditions in the solar nebula. Debris from planetesimal collisions around other stars signposts that the planetesimal formation process, and hence planet formation, is ubiquitous in the Galaxy. The planetesimal formation stage extends from micrometer-sized dust and ice to bodies that can undergo runaway accretion. The latter ranges in size from 1 km to 1000 km, dependent on the planetesimal eccentricity excited by turbulent gas density fluctuations. Particles face many barriers during this growth, arising mainly from inefficient sticking, fragmentation, and radial drift. Two promising growth pathways are mass transfer, where small aggregates transfer up to 50% of their mass in high-speed collisions with much larger targets, and fluffy growth, where aggregate cross sections and sticking probabilities are enhanced by a low internal density. A wide range of particle sizes, from 1 mm to 10 m, concentrate in the turbulent gas flow. Overdense filaments fragment gravitationally into bound particle clumps, with most mass entering planetesimals of contracted radii from 100 km to 500 km, depending on local disk properties. We propose a hybrid model for planetesimal formation where particle growth starts unaided by self-gravity but later proceeds inside gravitationally collapsing pebble clumps to form planetesimals with a wide range of sizes.",

This review examines the experimental achievements and puts them into the context of the dust processes in protoplanetary disks. It has become clear that planetesimal formation starts with the growth of fractal dust aggregates, followed by compaction processes. As the dust-aggregate sizes increase, the mean collision velocity also increases, leading to the stalling of the growth and possibly to fragmentation, once the dust aggregates have reached decimeter sizes. A multitude of hypotheses for the further growth have been proposed, such as very sticky materials, secondary collision processes, enhanced growth at the snow line, or cumulative dust effects with gravitational instability.

Motions of bodies less than about 1 km in size were dominated by gas drag rather than gravity. An original population of microscopic grains had to produce greater than km-sized planetesimals before gravitational accretion of planets could begin. Planetesimals probably formed by coagulation of grain aggregates that collided due to differential settling, turbulence, and drag-induced orbital decay. Growth of such aggregates depended on sticking mechanisms and their mechanical properties, which are poorly understood. Their growth was aided by concentration of larger bodies toward the central plane of the disk. The nebula could remain optically thick during this process. It is unlikely that a particle layer formed by settling would undergo gravitational instability, as a small amount of turbulence would keep the particle layer from reaching the critical density. This conclusion is independent of the particle size, as even large bodies do not effectively decouple from the gas.

We performed laboratory experiments to study the collisional behavior of dust aggregates in this size range at velocities below and around the fragmentation threshold. We developed two independent experimental setups with the same goal: to study the effects of bouncing, fragmentation, and mass transfer in free particle-particle collisions. The first setup is an evacuated drop tower with a free-fall height of 1.5 m, providing us with 0.56 s of microgravity time, so that we observed collisions with velocities between 8 mm s<SUP>-1</SUP> and 2 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The second setup is designed to study the effect of partial fragmentation (when only one of the two aggregates is destroyed) and mass transfer in more detail. It allows for the measurement of the accretion efficiency because the samples are safely recovered after the encounter. At very low velocities, we found that bouncing was as expected, while the fragmentation velocity of 20 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP> was significantly lower than expected. We present the critical energy for disruptive collisions Q <SUP>sstarf</SUP>, which were at least two orders of magnitude lower than previous experiments in the literature. In the wide range between bouncing and disruptive collisions, only one of the samples fragmented in the encounter, while the other gained mass. The accretion efficiency on the order of a few percentage points of the particle's mass depends on the impact velocity and the sample porosity. Our results will have consequences for dust evolution models in protoplanetary disks as well as for the strength of large, porous planetesimal bodies.",

      "abstract": "The size distribution of asteroids and Kuiper belt objects in the solar system is difficult to reconcile with a bottom-up formation scenario due to the observed scarcity of objects smaller than ~100 km in size. Instead, planetesimals appear to form top-down, with large 100-1000 km bodies forming from the rapid gravitational collapse of dense clumps of small solid particles. In this paper we investigate the conditions under which solid particles can form dense clumps in a protoplanetary disk. We used a hydrodynamic code to model the interaction between solid particles and the gas inside a shearing box inside the disk, considering particle sizes from submillimeter-sized chondrules to meter-sized rocks. We found that particles down to millimeter sizes can form dense particle clouds through the run-away convergence of radial drift known as the streaming instability. We made a map of the range of conditions (strength of turbulence, particle mass-loading, disk mass, and distance to the star) that are prone to producing dense particle clumps. Finally, we estimate the distribution of collision speeds between mm-sized particles. We calculated the rate of sticking collisions and obtain a robust upper limit on the particle growth timescale of ~10<SUP>5</SUP> years. This means that mm-sized chondrule aggregates can grow on a timescale much smaller than the disk accretion timescale (~10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> years). Our results suggest a pathway from the mm-sized grains found in primitive meteorites to fully formed asteroids. We speculate that asteroids may form from a positive feedback loop in which coagualation leads to particle clumping driven by the streaming instability. This clumping, in turn, reduces collision speeds and enhances coagulation. Future simulations should model coagulation and the streaming instability together to explore this feedback loop further. <P />Appendices are available in electronic form at <A href=\"http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201425120/olm\">http://www.aanda.org</A>",

Understanding the structure evolution of dust aggregates is a key in planetesimal formation. Dust grains become fluffy by coagulation in protoplanetary disks. However, once they are fluffy, they are not sufficiently compressed by collisional compression to form compact planetesimals. <BR /> Aims: We aim to reveal the pathway of dust structure evolution from dust grains to compact planetesimals. <BR /> Methods: Using the compressive strength formula, we analytically investigate how fluffy dust aggregates are compressed by static compression due to ram pressure of the disk gas and self-gravity of the aggregates in protoplanetary disks. <BR /> Results: We reveal the pathway of the porosity evolution from dust grains via fluffy aggregates to form planetesimals, circumventing the barriers in planetesimal formation. The aggregates are compressed by the disk gas to a density of 10<SUP>-3</SUP> g/cm<SUP>3</SUP> in coagulation, which is more compact than is the case with collisional compression. Then, they are compressed more by self-gravity to 10<SUP>-1</SUP> g/cm<SUP>3</SUP> when the radius is 10 km. Although the gas compression decelerates the growth, the aggregates grow rapidly enough to avoid the radial drift barrier when the orbital radius is \u22726 AU in a typical disk. <BR /> Conclusions: We propose a fluffy dust growth scenario from grains to planetesimals. It enables icy planetesimal formation in a wide range beyond the snowline in protoplanetary disks.

It is triggered at a particular disk location where the local volume density of solids exceeds that of the gas. After their formation, planetesimals can grow into protoplanets by feeding from other planetesimals in the birth ring as well as by accreting inwardly drifting pebbles from the outer disk. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the growth of planetesimals into protoplanets at a single location through streaming instability. For a solar-mass star, we test the conditions under which super-Earths are able to form within the lifetime of the gaseous disk. <BR /> Methods: We modified the Mercury N-body code to trace the growth and dynamical evolution of a swarm of planetesimals at a distance of 2.7 AU from the star. The code simulates gravitational interactions and collisions among planetesimals, gas drag, type I torque, and pebble accretion. Three distributions of planetesimal sizes were investigated: (i) a mono-dispersed population of 400 km radius planetesimals, (ii) a poly-dispersed population of planetesimals from 200 km up to 1000 km, (iii) a bimodal distribution with a single runaway body and a swarm of smaller, 100 km size planetesimals. <BR /> Results: The mono-dispersed population of 400 km size planetesimals cannot form protoplanets of a mass greater than that of the Earth. Their eccentricities and inclinations are quickly excited, which suppresses both planetesimal accretion and pebble accretion. Planets can form from the poly-dispersed and bimodal distributions. In these circumstances, it is the two-component nature that damps the random velocity of the large embryo through the dynamical friction of small planetesimals, allowing the embryo to accrete pebbles efficiently when it approaches 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M<SUB>\u2295</SUB>. Accounting for migration, close-in super-Earth planets form. Super-Earth planets are likely to form when the pebble mass flux is higher, the disk turbulence is lower, or the Stokes number of the pebbles is higher. <BR /> Conclusions: For the single site planetesimal formation scenario, a two-component mass distribution with a large embryo and small planetesimals promotes planet growth, first by planetesimal accretion and then by pebble accretion of the most massive protoplanet. Planetesimal formation at single locations such as ice lines naturally leads to super-Earth planets by the combined mechanisms of planetesimal accretion and pebble accretion.",

Despite this fragmentation barrier, planets are known to exist in such (so-called S-type) orbital configurations. Here we present a novel numerical framework for carrying out multi-annulus coagulation-fragmentation calculations of planetesimal growth, which fully accounts for the specifics of planetesimal dynamics in binaries, details of planetesimal collision outcomes, and the radial transport of solids in the disk due to the gas drag-driven inspiral. Our dynamical inputs properly incorporate the gravitational effects of both the eccentric stellar companion and the massive non-axisymmetric protoplanetary disk in which planetesimals reside, as well as gas drag. We identify a set of disk parameters that lead to successful planetesimal growth in systems such as \u03b3 Cephei or \u03b1 Centauri starting from 1 to 10 km size objects. We identify the apsidal alignment of a protoplanetary disk with the binary orbit as one of the critical conditions for successful planetesimal growth: It naturally leads to the emergence of a dynamically quiet location in the disk (as long as the disk eccentricity is of order several percent), where favorable conditions for planetesimal growth exist. Accounting for the gravitational effect of a protoplanetary disk plays a key role in arriving at this conclusion, in agreement with our previous results. These findings lend support to the streaming instability as the mechanism of planetesimal formation. They provide important insights for theories of planet formation around both binary and single stars, as well as for the hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks in binaries (for which we identify a set of key diagnostics to verify).",
