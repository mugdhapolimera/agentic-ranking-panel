  "abstract": "The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) instrument onboard the Cassini spacecraft observed 41 solar occultations by Saturn's rings through its extreme ultraviolet (56-118 nm) spectrographic channel. These solar occultations complement the set of stellar occultations measured by the broadband UVIS High Speed Photometer in the far ultraviolet (110-190 nm). We provide a uniform calibration of all of the UVIS solar occultation data across the full ring system. We have compiled complete catalogs of these occultations as high-level data products delivered to the Planetary Data System (PDS) Ring Moon Systems Node. This manuscript serves as a guide to this dataset and the corresponding high-level data products outlining their value for analysis of Saturn's rings. These products include light curves and optical depth profiles as functions of ring radius. In addition to providing key parameters of interest obtained through each of these occultations, we show that the optical depths of various ring regions derived from solar occultations are consistent with those from stellar occultations. We also demonstrate that fits to self-gravity wake parameters are similar for solar and stellar occultations. Lastly, we identify a variety of potential spectral trends at various ring locations that future investigations may further explore to address key questions pertaining to the properties of Saturn's rings.",

The UVIS Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) channel observed these occultations with spectra recorded from 56 to 118 nm, typical spectral resolution of 0.1 nm, and typical spatial resolution of 600 km. These solar occultations complement the set of stellar occultations measured by the broadband UVIS High Speed Photometer (HSP) at 110-190 nm. Prior studies have used the solar occultation data of the F ring in conjunction with Cassini images to constrain the abundance of small particles released in major collisional events in the ring (Becker et al. 2018, Icarus, 306, 171-199). Here we provide a uniform calibration of all the solar occultation data across the full ring system.

      "abstract": "On the largest scales Saturn's rings are often thought of as axisymmetric annuli varying only radially in optical depth with exceptions of spiral waves and eccentric ringlets. But on scales smaller than a few tens of km yet still larger than the largest common ring particles, the assumption of azimuthal symmetry breaks down. Structures such as \"straw\" in the troughs of density waves, partial gaps around propeller moonlets, and ephemeral particle aggregates such as self-gravity wakes are responsible for the predominant variations in optical depth. During the 13 year Cassini mission, the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) high speed photometer (HSP) measured 80 stellar chord occultations of Saturn's main rings. In the vicinity of the minimum ring plane radius of each chord, the occultation line-of-sight slewed across the ring plane tangent to the Keplerian motion of the ring particles. These occultations measured ultraviolet light in the wavelength range 110\u2013190 nm with 1- or 2-ms ms integration times, providing optical depth measurements with resolution comparable to the Fresnel scale of <mml:math altimg=\"si1.svg\" display=\"inline\" id=\"d1e5821\"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>\u223c</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math> m in the frame co-moving with the local Keplerian speed. These high-resolution chord occultations reach their minimum ring radii over a broad range of radial locations within Saturn's main rings and resolve non-axisymmetric structures in a wide variety of ring regions. We measure the azimuthal length scales and optical depth profiles of \"ghosts\", or azimuthally limited gaps with radial scales less than 30 m (Bailli\u00e9 et al., 2013), in the C ring plateaus. We measure the length scale of transparent gaps and self-gravity wakes in the peaks and troughs of spiral density waves. We present optical depth profiles which resolve axisymmetric waves in the A and B rings and constrain the azimuthal length scale over which the waves remain axisymmetric to <mml:math altimg=\"si238.svg\" display=\"inline\" id=\"d1e5829\"><mml:mo>\u223c</mml:mo></mml:math>1000 km. We combine autocorrelation length scales from stellar occultations which cut across the minimum ring radius of a chord occultation with line-of-sight trajectories from other occultations which are not tangent to the rings to constrain the morphology of the azimuthally and temporally averaged mesoscale structures at that ring radius. 2D autocorrelation profiles from stellar occultations show self-gravity wakes and axisymmetric waves often coexisting.",

      "abstract": "The Cassini spacecraft's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) includes a high speed photometer (HSP) that has observed stellar occultations by Saturn's rings with a radial resolution of \u223c10 m. In the absence of intervening ring material, the time series of measurements by the HSP is described by Poisson statistics in which the variance equals the mean. The finite sizes of the ring particles occulting the star lead to a variance that is larger than the mean due to correlations in the blocking of photons due to finite particle size and due to random variations in the number of individual particles in each measurement area. This effect was first exploited by Showalter and Nicholson (1990) with the stellar occultation observed by Voyager 2. At a given optical depth, a larger excess variance corresponds to larger particles or clumps that results in greater variation of the signal from measurement to measurement. Here we present analysis of the excess variance in occultations observed by Cassini UVIS. We observe differences in the best-fitting particle size in different ring regions. The C ring plateaus show a distinctly smaller effective particle size, R, than the background C ring, while the background C ring itself shows a positive correlation between R and optical depth. The innermost 700 km of the B ring has a distribution of excess variance with optical depth that is consistent with the C ring ramp and C ring but not with the remainder of the B1 region. The Cassini Division, while similar to the C ring in spectral and structural properties, has different trends in effective particle size with optical depth. There are discrete jumps in R on either side of the Cassini Division ramp, while the C ring ramp shows a smooth transition in R from the C ring to the B ring. The A ring is dominated by self-gravity wakes whose shadow size depends on the occultation geometry. The spectral ;halo; regions around the strongest density waves in the A ring correspond to decreases in R. There is also a pronounced dip in R at the Mimas 5:3 bending wave corresponding to an increase in optical depth there, suggesting that at these waves small particles are liberated from clumps or self-gravity wakes leading to a reduction in effective particle size and an increase in optical depth.",

      "abstract": "The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) High Speed Photometer (HSP) aboard the Cassini spacecraft observed 275 stellar occultations by Saturn's rings from a variety of viewing geometries. Statistical moments of the data, such as the mean, variance, and skewness, provide a range of information about the structure of the rings, whether large-scale, small-scale, or in between. The mean signal of the HSP data is used to calculate the line-of-sight optical depth over the range sample, while the variance is used to infer an effective particle size (Showalter and Nicholson 1990 Icarus 87, 285; Colwell et al. 2018 Icarus 300, 150). The next-higher moment after variance, the skewness of the distribution of measured star brightnesses, is relatively insensitive to particle size but is strongly perturbed by the presence of even a small fractional coverage of openings dubbed \"ghosts\" in the rings that may be the result of miniature moonlets (Bailli\u00e9 et al. 2013, Astron. J. 145, 171). Comparisons between the skewness of the data as a function of optical depth provide insight about local structures within the rings, such as the presence of clumps and ghosts. We compare the observed distribution of skewness with those from simulated occultations from both Monte Carlo and dynamical N-body simulations of the rings. We present the lag in the autocorrelation of the occultation data to study variations in ring structure on the scale of several HSP measurement intervals (~100 m in ring plane radius). By analyzing these from occultations observed at different elevation angles to the rings we identify changes in the vertical structure of the rings across the ring system as well. We will present the results of our analyses of the UVIS data along with comparisons to the Monte Carlo and N-body simulations.",

Over the course of the Cassini mission to Saturn, the UVIS HSP recorded photon count rates for 276 stellar occultations of Saturn's main rings. These stellar occultations trace a 1 dimensional path through the rings, and due to the high sampling rate of the UVIS HSP, the azimuthal and radial resolution are on the order of the Fresnel scale (\u221a\u03bbD), about 10 m [1, 2] in the frame of the ring particles. Stellar occultations are offset widely in time and azimuth, but by combining autocorrelations of the occultation time series, we develop a 2-D autocorrelation of the temporally and azimuthally averaged structure at a given ring radius. 2-D autocorrelations allow us to study the rings on the scale of the largest individual particles in the rings. Ring particles aggregate and disperse creating self-gravity wakes [3, 4] as well as what has been referred to as \"streaky texture\", \"feathery texture\", and \"straw\" [5] in Cassini images which have pixel scales as low as 300 m in the frame of the ring particles. By comparing autocorrelations from the UVIS HSP stellar occultations with images from Cassini Imaging Subsystem (ISS), and n-body simulations we determine the properties of the mesoscale structures at a given ring radius. Mesoscale structure refers to agglomerations of particles which are bigger than the largest individual ring particles but smaller than a few km.

      "abstract": "Cassini's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) observed 276 stellar occultations of Saturn's rings over the course of its mission. During these occultations, UVIS' High-Speed Photometer (HSP) collected photon count measurements through the rings at a typical radial resolution of 10 meters from a wide range of viewing angles. Because photon counts are Poisson distributed, the variance of the starlight is approximately equal to its mean in the absence of occulting ring material. When the star passes behind the rings from the point-of view of the spacecraft, the finite sizes of the ring particles result in an excess variance above the mean caused by correlation in the blocking of photons. Showalter and Nicholson (1990, Icarus, 87, 285) and Colwell et al. (2018, Icarus, 300, 150) interpreted this excess variance in terms of an effective particle or clump size, RE, which depends on the length scale of shadows cast by particles and clumps. In the A ring however, where ring particles aggregate into trailing spiral structures called self-gravity wakes (Colwell et al., 2006, Colwell et al., 2007, Hedman et al., 2007, Nicholson and Hedman (2010), the assumptions of Showalter and Nicholson (1990) and Colwell et al. (2018) of uncorrelated spherical particles are invalid.Here we expand their analyses to account for the presence of self-gravity wakes, ephemeral agglomerations of ring particles under the competing influence of their mutual self-gravity and Keplerian shear, by introducing free parameters S(wake separation), and W (wake width) into a direct calculation of higher order statistical moments of excess variance, skewness, and kurtosis from the expectation value of the random variate, ring transparency (T). We use the granola bar model of self-gravity wakes (Colwell et al. 2006) to calculate the autocovariance of the measured signal. In this work we compare the values of these higher order moments in the peaks and troughs of the Janus 2:1, Pandora 5:4, Janus 5:4, and Janus 6:5 density waves, which exist in regions in which self-gravity wakes are prominent. We compare the best-fit combinations of S and W to the excess variance for many combinations of S and W from different ring regions to reveal trends in the variation of wake properties by ring region. The sum S+W is constrained by the measured dispersion of the waves which gives the local surface mass density. We use this value to determine the Toomre most-unstable wavelength which we assume to be equal to the self-gravity wake wavelength (S+W) (Julian and Toomre, 1966). The second order moment, skewness (S), measures the asymmetry of the distribution and is indicative of either large clumps or small gaps in the rings nicknamed \"ghosts\" (Baillie et al., 2012). The presence of a few small gaps (high transparency outliers in the distribution) may lead to a positive skewness. The presence of too many gaps, however, increases the symmetry of the distribution as the gaps are no longer outliers. We take the ratio of S to \u03c4 to account for the correlation between the two variables (S is proportional to \u03c4 when \u03c4 \u2273 1). We occasionally observe that the ratio in the troughs differs by more than one standard deviation from the ratio in the peaks of the density waves. Our results indicate that either there are more gaps (positive outliers) present in the troughs than in the peaks or that there are so many gaps in the peaks that they no longer stand out as outliers of the distribution.We apply this analysis technique to a multitude of occultations across a variety of ring elevation (B) and azimuthal (f) angles to survey wake parameter variation across these regions.

      "abstract": "The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) included a High-Speed Photometer (HSP), which observed hundreds of stellar occultations by Saturn's ring system across a range of viewing geometries (Colwell et al. 2010). The unocculted time series data from the HSP follow Poisson counting statistics, such that the second and third central moments of the unocculted data should be equal to the mean photon rate of the star. When the star is occulted by the rings, the presence of ring particles introduces a correlation in the previously uncorrelated photons. This causes each of the central moments to deviate from their expected value. In particular, the second central moment, \u03bc2, commonly known as the variance, becomes greater than the mean (Colwell et al. 2018). The third central moment, \u03bc3, also deviates from this expectation upon occultation, but the nature of the deviation varies with optical depth. In particular, \u03bc3 is less than its Poisson expectation for \u03c4&lt;0.33 and greater than this expectation for \u03c4&gt;0.33. The introduction of outlier features, namely small gaps ('ghosts', Bailli\u00e9 et al. (2013)) and clumps produce variable effects on the behavior of both \u03bc2 and \u03bc3, which is also dependent on optical depth. We compare the higher-order moments from Monte Carlo Simulations of a simplified ring system to those from the UVIS data to gain insight into the nature of such outliers in the C ring and Cassini Division. The behavior of the data in the C ring plateaus indicates that a small population of \u223c 10-m ghosts exists in this region, with a frequency of about 1 ghost per km of radial extent. In the background C ring, we find that particle sizes are positively correlated with optical depth and the data cannot be explained with a simple power-law size distribution. Instead, we are able to describe the behavior of the higher-order moments using a bent-power law size distribution of particles. We find similar behavior in the C ring ramp and Cassini Division ramp. However, we cannot rule out nor confirm the presence of either ghosts or clumps in the background Cassini Division. In the Triple Band, the local \u223c 10-m ghost frequency oscillates between about 1 and 4 ghosts per km.",

      "abstract": "We have completed a series of local N-body simulations of Saturn's B and A rings in order to identify systematic differences in the degree of particle clumping into self-gravity wakes as a function of orbital distance from Saturn and dynamical optical depth (a function of surface density). These simulations revealed that the normal optical depth of the final configuration can be substantially lower than one would infer from a uniform distribution of particles. Adding more particles to the simulation simply piles more particles onto the self-gravity wakes while leaving relatively clear gaps between the wakes. Estimating the mass from the observed optical depth is therefore a non-linear problem. These simulations may explain why the Cassini UVIS instrument has detected starlight at low incidence angles through regions of the B ring that have average normal optical depths substantially greater than unity at some observation geometries [Colwell, J.E., Esposito, L.W., Srem\u010devi\u0107, M., Stewart, G.R., McClintock, W.E., 2007. Icarus 190, 127-144]. We provide a plausible internal density of the particles in the A and B rings based upon fitting the results of our simulations with Cassini UVIS stellar occultation data. We simulated Cassini-like occultations through our simulation cells, calculated optical depths, and attempted to extrapolate to the values that Cassini observes. We needed to extrapolate because even initial optical depths of &gt;4 ( \u03c3 &gt; 240 g cm <SUP>-2</SUP>) only yielded final optical depths no greater than 2.8, smaller than the largest measured B ring optical depths. This extrapolation introduces a significant amount of uncertainty, and we chose to be conservative in our overall mass estimates. From our simulations, we infer the surface density of the A ring to be \u03c3=42-54gcm, which corresponds to a mass of 0.5\u00d710<SUP>19</SUP>kg-0.7\u00d710<SUP>19</SUP>kg. We infer a minimum surface density of \u03c3=240-480gcm for Saturn's B ring, which corresponds to a minimum mass estimate of 4\u00d710<SUP>19</SUP>kg-7\u00d710<SUP>19</SUP>kg. The A ring mass estimate agrees well with previous analyses, while the B ring is at least 40% larger. In sum, our lower limit estimate is that the total mass of Saturn's ring system is 120-200% the mass of the moon Mimas, but significantly larger values would be plausible given the limitations of our simulations. A significantly larger mass for Saturn's rings favors a primordial origin for the rings because the disruption of a former satellite of the required mass would be unlikely after the decay of the late heavy bombardment of planetary surfaces.",

      "abstract": "Stellar occultations provide the highest spatial resolution data of Saturns rings but only as one-dimensional transparency profiles. The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) High Speed Photometer (HSP) measured 277 occultations of UV-bright stars by Saturns rings over a range of viewing geometries and with varying coverage of the rings. Almost all were observed with sampling rates of 1-2 ms and Fresnel scales (D) of ~10 m. For 119 of these stellar occultations, the line-of-sight from the star to Cassini traced a chord across the rings over the course of the observation. Near the minimum ring plane radius of each of these chords, the occultation point in the rings moved tangentially to the ring particles orbital direction for several hundreds of km in ring azimuth in the frame comoving with the ring particles. In the same time interval, the occultation point moved less than 10 m in ring radius. While studies of large-scale ring properties often treat the rings as azimuthally symmetric, azimuthally limited structures are observed frequently on scales ranging from hundreds of m to several tens of km in the local Keplerian frame. The largest of these mesoscale structures are observed in Cassini Imaging Subsystem (ISS) particle tracking images which slewed with the orbital motion of the particles with pixel scales as low as 300 m. In images these structures are referred to as streaky texture, feathery texture, and straw, and their formation mechanism is poorly understood. At each of the minimum ring radii of the 119 UVIS chord occultations we characterize the azimuthal ring structure by comparing occultation data with Cassini ISS images and n-body simulations in order to determine how the local ring particle size distribution and dynamical environment influence the formation of quasi-stable mesoscale structures in the rings. We find evidence of self-gravity wake formation in regions dominated by 150 m viscous over-stable waves in the A and B rings as well as azimuthally extended lobes of 10 20 m propeller moonlets in the C ring plateaus.",

      "abstract": "The distribution of particle sizes in Saturn's rings roughly follows a truncated inverse power-law. Though it is well known that differential optical depths provide a way to probe the parameters of size distribution (i.e. Zebker et al. [1985] Icarus, 64, 531-548), the technique is complicated by the presence of self-gravity wakes which introduce a geometric dependence to the observed optical depth. Here we present a method of extracting information about the size distribution of the particles in the gaps between the self-gravity wakes. The Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) occultations measure starlight at an effective wavelength of 2.9 \u03bcm falling onto a single pixel with angular dimensions 0.25 mrad \u00d7 0.5 mrad while Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) occultations measure starlight at a much smaller effective wavelength of 0.15 \u03bcm and over a field of view with larger angular dimensions of 6.0 mrad \u00d7 6.4 mrad. Starlight diffracted out of the VIMS pixel by particles smaller than 1.22\u03bb<SUB>VIMS</SUB>/2\u03b8 \u223c8.86 mm, is not replaced by neighboring particles, while the UVIS instrument, with its larger field of view and smaller effective wavelength, collects all of the light diffracted by particles larger than 1.22\u03bb<SUB>VIMS</SUB>/2\u03b8 \u223c0.025 mm. Consequently, measurements by VIMS overstate the optical depth in regions where sub-centimeter-sized particles are present. Using the rectangular cross section wake model of (Colwell et al. [2006], Geophys. Res. Lett., 33, L07201) and (Colwell et al. [2007] Icarus, 190, 127-144) with a new parameter to represent the excess VIMS optical depth not seen by UVIS, we combine VIMS and UVIS occultations for the first time for particle size analysis. We find a significant fraction of sub-cm particles only in the outermost portion of the A ring, and in the B1 region of the B ring. In the Trans-Encke region, we find a trend of increasing abundance of sub-cm particles as the outer edge of the A Ring is approached, consistent with previous differential optical depth studies at radio wavelengths (Zebker et al. [1985] Icarus, 64, 531-548), measurements of diffraction in stellar occultations at the ring edges (Becker et al. [2015] Icarus), and measurements from VIMS solar occultations (Harbison et al. [2013] Icarus, 226, 1225-1240). This may be due to greater erosion of weakly bound particle aggregates by interparticle collisions in regions where satellite perturbations are strong.",

The variance of the data exceeds that expected from Poisson statistics due to the finite sizes of clumps and particles in the rings, and this has been used to study variations in mean particle size (Colwell et al. 2018, Icarus, 300, 150). The skewness of the data is related to both particle size and the presence of outliers (unusually high or low counts) that can be caused by big clumps in low optical depth regions or gaps or holes in moderate to high optical depth regions (Green et al. 2019, AGU #P23C-3506). We created a library of occultation statistics from simulated occultations of Monte Carlo simulations of a two-dimensional ring system composed of circular particles with interspersed clumps and small gaps or \"ghosts\". We vary the effective particle radius (R), the probability of a measurement encountering a ghost (GP), and the probability of encountering a clump (CP). We calculate the skewness (S) and the excess variance (E) from the simulated occultations, over a range of optical depths. We find that ghosts are necessary to simultaneously fit E and S in the C ring plateaus. We test different occultations across a range of inclination angles and star brightnesses and find effective particles sizes on the order of 1 m, and a small population of ghosts, from 0.1-2% of measurement samples. In the background C ring, we find that the abundance of ghosts is less than in the plateaus while the mean particle size is larger, consistent with Colwell et al. (2018). Additionally, we generate three-dimensional, collisional, self-gravity n-body simulations, with embedded moonlets that produce localized openings referred to as \"propellers\" (Tiscareno et al. 2006, Nature, 440, 648). Simulated occultations of these n-body simulations produce enhanced skewness like that seen in the UVIS data, confirming that large embedded objects may be the cause of the ghosts in the C ring plateaus revealed by the skewness of the UVIS occultation data. Future work will extend these analyses to other ring regions such as the A and B rings.",

In Saturn's A ring, diffracted light can augment the direct stellar signal by up to 6% and can be detected tens of kilometers radially from the edge. The radial profile of the diffraction signal is dependent on the size distribution of the particle population near the ring edge. These diffraction signals are clearly observed at sharp edges throughout Saturn's ring system.

We find an overall steepening of the power-law size distribution and a decrease in the minimum particle size at the outer edge of the A ring when compared with the Encke Gap edges. This suggests that interparticle collisions caused by satellite perturbations in the region result in more shedding of regolith or fragmentation of particles in the outermost parts of the A ring.

These ephemeral structures result from the competition between the mutual gravitational attraction of ring particles and tidal shear acting to pull them apart (Julian and Toomre 1966, Astrophys. J., 146, 810). Self-gravity wakes are elongated and canted to the orbital direction by about 20-25 degrees. This preferential orientation and the spacing between the self-gravity wakes results in a geometry-dependent transparency of the rings that is observed in stellar occultations. The surface mass density of the Cassini Division and the C ring is lower than that of the A and B rings so that the most unstable length scale for gravitational collapse is comparable in size to individual ring particles. Thus, self-gravity wakes are not anticipated. However, one signature of self-gravity wakes is an increase in apparent normal optical depth with increasing occultation elevation angle, B. This is observed for all values of B in the A and B rings but not in the C ring and Cassini Division. Here we report on stellar occultation measurements of the C ring ramp and plateaus and the Cassini Division ramp and triple band structure made by the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) High Speed Photometer (HSP), the Cassini Radio Science Subsystem (RSS), and the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) over a broad range of viewing geometries. The normal optical depth of the C ring and Cassini Division does increase at small values of B. These variations can be caused by the finite vertical thickness of the rings and the distribution of under-dense or empty regions between particles and clumps. We present our results on ring vertical thickness and particle clump characteristics in the C ring and Cassini Division from Cassini occultation data.",

      "abstract": "On July 14, 2005, the Cassini UltraViolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) observed the occultation of Bellatrix (gamma Orionis) as it passed behind Enceladus as seen from the spacecraft. The UVIS High Speed Photometer recorded a decrease in signal intensity ~24 seconds prior to occultation of the star by the hard limb, consistent with the presence of an atmosphere. The UVIS Far UltraViolet (FUV) channel recorded absorption features as the starlight passed through the atmosphere. The absorptions allowed us to identify water vapor as the primary composition of the atmosphere, with a column density of ~1.5e16 per square cm. This is the column density at 20 to 40 km above the surface. Non- detection of absorption features associated with CO, H2, and molecular oxygen allows us to place upper limits on the mixing ratio of these gases with respect to water. The quantity of water vapor coming from Enceladus is adequate to supply the atomic oxygen detected in the Saturn system by UVIS and to re-supply Saturn's E ring. An occultation of lambda Scorpius in February of 2005 did not show any sign of an atmosphere, and the presence of an atmosphere was also not sensed during the occultation egress of Bellatrix. This allows us to conclude that the water vapor cloud is localized - the atmosphere of Enceladus is more like a plume and not global in extent.",

      "abstract": "The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) High Speed Photometer (HSP) recorded over 270 full or partial occultations of stars by Saturn's rings. The ring structure in these data is usually represented by the optical depth which is derived from the mean, or the first moment, of the data. Previous work has shown that information on particle or clump sizes can be retrieved from the second moment, or variance, of the data (Showalter and Nicholson 1990, Icarus, 87, 285; Colwell et al. 2018, Icarus, 300, 150). The presence of localized openings or \"ghosts\" in the rings can be detected from analysis of the third moment, or skewness, of the data (Green et al. 2019, Fall AGU #P23C-3506). Here we present a standardized pictorial atlas of these moments, and the fourth moment (kurtosis) for the UVIS ring stellar occultations. These will be delivered to the NASA Planetary Data System in tabular format. Moments are calculated from data in radial bins of 10 km, corresponding to about 1000 data points in a typical occultation. We also calculate the auto-correlation of the data as a function of offset, or lag, and present the lag for the autocorrelation to reach zero, which provides another measure of the radial scale of structure in the rings.",
