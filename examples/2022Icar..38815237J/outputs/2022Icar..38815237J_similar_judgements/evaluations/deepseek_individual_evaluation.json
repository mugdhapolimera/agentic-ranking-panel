    "1": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is nearly identical to the main paper, discussing the same solar occultations, data calibration, and comparisons with stellar occultations. It directly aligns with the main paper's methodology and focus, making it highly relevant."
    },
    "2": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Focuses on UVIS stellar occultations and small-scale structures like self-gravity wakes. While the main paper uses solar occultations, this result's analysis of ring structures is relevant to the broader study of Saturn's rings."
    },
    "3": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Discusses UVIS stellar occultation calibration and 3D structure inversion. Relevant to the main paper's methodological context, though focused on stellar rather than solar data."
    },
    "4": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Provides a general overview of the UVIS instrument. While it contextualizes the tool used in the main paper, it lacks specific focus on solar occultations or the study's analysis."
    },
    "5": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Similar to Result 4, this describes the UVIS instrument broadly but does not address the main paper's specific solar occultation analysis."
    },
    "6": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Examines particle sizes using UVIS stellar occultations. The variance analysis methodology aligns with the main paper's optical depth comparisons, making it relevant."
    },
    "7": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Analyzes statistical moments (variance, skewness) from stellar occultations. Methodologically relevant to the main paper's study of ring structures and optical depth."
    },
    "8": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Uses autocorrelations from stellar occultations to study mesoscale structures. Relevant to the main paper's focus on self-gravity wakes and small-scale features."
    },
    "9": {
      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "Focuses on VIMS occultations, a different instrument. Not relevant to the UVIS solar occultation analysis in the main paper."
    },
    "10": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "Directly addresses self-gravity wake parameters using UVIS stellar occultations, closely aligned with the main paper's comparison of wake properties across occultation types."
    },
    "11": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Analyzes higher-order moments in the C ring and Cassini Division. Relevant to the main paper's regional comparisons but uses stellar rather than solar data."
    },
    "12": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Estimates ring masses via N-body simulations and UVIS data. Tangentially related to the main paper's structural analysis but focuses on a different aspect (mass)."
    },
    "13": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Studies azimuthal structures using UVIS stellar occultations. The topic overlaps with the main paper's interest in ring structures, though methodology differs."
    },
    "14": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Combines UVIS and VIMS data for particle size analysis. Partially relevant but introduces a different instrument, diverging from the main paper's focus."
    },
    "15": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Characterizes the C ring using UVIS data, discussing particle sizes and gaps. Relevant to the main paper's regional analysis of Saturn's rings."
    },
    "16": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Examines particle size distribution in the A ring via diffraction spikes. Relevant to the main paper's broader interest in particle properties but narrower in scope."
    },
    "17": {
      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "Focuses on Phoebe, a moon, not Saturn's rings. Entirely unrelated to the main paper's topic."
    },
    "18": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Discusses C ring and Cassini Division structures using UVIS data. Directly relevant to the main paper's regional analysis."

    "weaknesses": [
      "Some results focus on different instruments (VIMS) or targets (moons), reducing relevance.",
      "Overlap in UVIS instrument descriptions (Results 4, 5) adds redundancy without deepening the main paper's analysis.",
      "A few results (e.g., Result 12) diverge into tangential topics like mass estimation."

    "suggestions": [
      "Prioritize results that explicitly compare solar and stellar occultations or analyze self-gravity wake parameters.",
      "Exclude results focused on non-ring targets (e.g., moons) or unrelated methodologies (e.g., N-body mass simulations).",
      "Combine overlapping instrumental descriptions to avoid redundancy while retaining key context."
