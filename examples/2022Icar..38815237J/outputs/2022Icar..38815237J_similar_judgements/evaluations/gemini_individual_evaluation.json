    "1": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is highly relevant because it is essentially the same paper as the main paper, just presented as an overview or abstract. It discusses the same solar occultation observations of Saturn's rings using Cassini UVIS, the same data products, and the same objectives."
    },
    "2": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it discusses the analysis of Saturn's rings using Cassini UVIS stellar occultations, which complements the solar occultation method mentioned in the main paper. It focuses on small-scale structures and provides details about the high-resolution data obtained, which are valuable for understanding the ring dynamics and morphology. While it focuses on stellar occultations rather than solar, the techniques and overall goal are similar."
    },
    "3": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it describes the standardized technique applied to Cassini UVIS-HSP ring occultation datasets, regardless of the light source (star). The main paper discusses solar occultations but mentions that they complement stellar occultations. This paper provides vital information on how the data is processed which is valuable for interpreting and combining the results from both methods."
    },
    "4": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant as it describes the Cassini UVIS instrument itself and its various science objectives, including the study of Saturn's rings. However, it does not specifically focus on the occultation method or the analysis of occultation data, making it only tangentially related to the main paper's focus."
    },
    "5": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant as it describes the Cassini UVIS instrument and its observations of Saturn's rings, including stellar occultations. However, it doesn't focus on solar occultations (the main topic) or detailed data analysis techniques, making it only tangentially related."
    },
    "6": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it uses UVIS stellar occultation data to analyze particle sizes in Saturn's rings, a topic directly related to the main paper's objective of understanding the properties of the rings. Although it focuses on stellar rather than solar occultations, the underlying goal of characterizing the ring particles is the same."
    },
    "7": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it discusses the use of statistical moments of UVIS stellar occultation data to study ring structure. While the main paper focuses on solar occultations, this paper uses similar techniques for stellar occultations to study the rings, which is highly related."
    },
    "8": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it utilizes UVIS stellar occultation data to investigate mesoscale structures in Saturn's rings. The methodology of using autocorrelations is relevant to understanding ring properties, even though the light source is different from the main paper's focus."
    },
    "9": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant as it describes occultation observations of Saturn's rings, but it is done with the VIMS instrument, not UVIS (which is the instrument of focus in the main paper). It also focuses on both stellar and solar occultations generally, making it less specific to the methodology of the main paper."
    },
    "10": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it discusses characterization of self-gravity wake morphology in Saturn's rings from Cassini UVIS stellar occultation statistics. The analysis of stellar occultation data from UVIS is directly related to the techniques used in the main paper, even if the specific focus is on self-gravity wakes."
    },
    "11": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it focuses on using Cassini UVIS stellar occultation data to characterize particle sizes and local gaps in Saturn's C ring. This is in line with the main paper's objective, even if the focus is on stellar occultations in the C ring."
    },
    "12": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant as it discusses estimating the masses of Saturn's A and B rings using stellar occultations. However, it focuses on modeling and simulations based on the occultation data, making it less directly related to the observational data analysis techniques of the main paper."
    },
    "13": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it studies small-scale azimuthal structure in Saturn's rings using stellar occultations. It utilizes the same instrument and similar analysis techniques (high spatial resolution data) as the main paper, even if the focus is on different structures."
    },
    "14": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it combines UVIS and VIMS occultations to analyze particle sizes in Saturn's rings. While it uses both instruments, the UVIS data and the overall goal of particle size analysis align with the main paper."
    },
    "15": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it focuses on characterization of particle sizes and local gaps in Saturn's C Ring from stellar occultation data using UVIS. It aligns with the main paper's general methodology, even with its focus on stellar occultations and C ring specific analysis."
    },
    "16": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it discusses characterizing the particle size distribution of Saturn's A ring with Cassini UVIS occultation data, focusing on diffraction spikes. The use of UVIS occultation data and the analysis of particle sizes are directly related to the main paper."
    },
    "17": {
      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "This result is not relevant to the main paper because it discusses UV observations of Phoebe, not Saturn's rings. The instrument is the same, but the target and scientific objectives are completely different."
    },
    "18": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant because it investigates the small-scale structures in Saturn's C Ring and Cassini Division, and mentions the use of Cassini UVIS data among other instruments (RSS, VIMS). However, it's broader scope, including different instruments, and the focus on specific regions make it only tangentially related."
    },
    "19": {
      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "This result is not relevant to the main paper because it discusses UVIS observations of Enceladus' plume, not Saturn's rings. While the instrument is the same, the target and scientific objectives are completely different."
