The key is the shared methodology and analytical techniques.",
              "reasoning": "The main paper uses solar occultations, but the underlying principle of using UVIS to analyze ring properties via occultation is the same. Stellar occultation results using UVIS contribute valuable information about the rings' structure, particle sizes, and dynamics. The discussion acknowledges stellar occultation data as 'complementary and relevant,' but Claude's view seems to undervalue this complementarity. My individual evaluations reflect this: I rated stellar occultation papers using UVIS between 2 and 3 (relevant to highly relevant), acknowledging their value while still recognizing the slightly greater relevance of solar occultation studies. Rejecting stellar occultation results outright ignores valuable data obtained using the same instrument and similar analytical techniques.",

This nuanced approach acknowledges the varying degrees of connection to the main paper while still capturing potentially valuable information."
