Its study provides us with important insight about its evolution. We developed a second generation of a N-body code based on the tidal model used in Mercury-T, re-implementing and improving its functionalities using Rust as programming language (including a Python interface for easy use) and the WHFAST integrator. The new open source code ensures memory safety, reproducibility of numerical N-body experiments, it improves the spin integration compared to Mercury-T and allows to take into account a new prescription for the dissipation of tidal inertial waves in the convective envelope of stars.

As such, it represents a remarkable setting to study the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets that formed in the same protoplanetary disk. While the sizes of the TRAPPIST-1 planets are all known to better than 5% precision, their densities have significant uncertainties (between 28% and 95%) because of poor constraints on the planet's masses. <BR /> Aims: The goal of this paper is to improve our knowledge of the TRAPPIST-1 planetary masses and densities using transit-timing variations (TTVs). The complexity of the TTV inversion problem is known to be particularly acute in multi-planetary systems (convergence issues, degeneracies and size of the parameter space), especially for resonant chain systems such as TRAPPIST-1. <BR /> Methods: To overcome these challenges, we have used a novel method that employs a genetic algorithm coupled to a full N-body integrator that we applied to a set of 284 individual transit timings. This approach enables us to efficiently explore the parameter space and to derive reliable masses and densities from TTVs for all seven planets. <BR /> Results: Our new masses result in a five- to eight-fold improvement on the planetary density uncertainties, with precisions ranging from 5% to 12%. These updated values provide new insights into the bulk structure of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. We find that TRAPPIST-1 c and e likely have largely rocky interiors, while planets b, d, f, g, and h require envelopes of volatiles in the form of thick atmospheres, oceans, or ice, in most cases with water mass fractions less than 5%.",

Here, we present the population synthesis code Multiple Stellar Evolution (MSE), designed to rapidly model the stellar, binary, and dynamical evolution of multiple-star systems.

However, sporadic libration and rotation induced by planetary interactions, such as those due to mean motion resonances (MMR) in compact planetary systems, may destabilize attendant exoplanets away from synchronized states (1:1 spin-orbit ratios). Here, we use a three-dimensional N-rigid-body integrator and an intermediately complex general circulation model to simulate the evolving climates of TRAPPIST-1 e and f with different orbital- and spin-evolution pathways. Planet f scenarios perturbed by MMR effects with chaotic spin variations are colder and dryer compared to their synchronized counterparts due to the zonal drift of the substellar point away from open ocean basins of their initial eyeball states. On the other hand, the differences between perturbed and synchronized planet e are minor due to higher instellation, warmer surfaces, and reduced climate hysteresis. This is the first study to incorporate the time-dependent outcomes of direct gravitational N-rigid-body simulations into 3D climate modeling of extrasolar planets, and our results show that planets at the outer edge of the habitable zones in compact multiplanet systems are vulnerable to rapid global glaciations. In the absence of external mechanisms such as orbital forcing or tidal heating, these planets could be trapped in permanent snowball states.",

Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the TRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In this work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of each planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure computed with the code Burnman. Our simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state. Planet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a result, the substellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and long-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with periods varying from 55 years to 290 years depending on the planet.",

      "abstract": "Observations of hot Jupiters around solar-type stars with very short orbital periods (\u223c1 d) suggest that tidal dissipation in such stars is not too efficient so that these planets can survive against rapid orbital decay. This is consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal quality factor, Q<SUB>\u2605</SUB>, of planet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from the circularization of stellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin effects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such systems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital angular momentum axis, but also show that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital axes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity-temperature correlation may be explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation in the convection zone of the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the survival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type parent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q<SUB>\u2605</SUB> governing the damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing orbital decay. This is because, for misaligned systems, the tidal potential contains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency (in the rotating frame of the star) and rotating opposite to the stellar spin. This component can excite inertial waves in the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial waves then leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque and a spin-down torque, but not orbital decay. By contrast, for aligned systems, such inertial wave excitation is forbidden since the tidal forcing frequency is much larger than the stellar spin frequency. We derive a general effective tidal evolution theory for misaligned binaries, taking account of different tidal responses and dissipation rates for different tidal forcing components.",

Thanks to transit-timing variations, the masses and therefore the bulk densities of the planets have been constrained, suggesting that all TRAPPIST-1 planets are consistent with water mass fractions on the order of 10%. These water fractions, as well as the similar planet masses within the system, constitute strong constraints on the origins of the TRAPPIST-1 system. In a previous work, we outlined a pebble-driven formation scenario. In this paper we investigate this formation scenario in more detail. We used a Lagrangian smooth-particle method to model the growth and drift of pebbles and the conversion of pebbles to planetesimals through the streaming instability. We used the N-body code MERCURY to follow the composition of planetesimals as they grow into protoplanets by merging and accreting pebbles. This code is adapted to account for pebble accretion, type-I migration, and gas drag. In this way, we modelled the entire planet formation process (pertaining to planet masses and compositions, not dynamical configuration). We find that planetesimals form in a single, early phase of streaming instability. The initially narrow annulus of planetesimals outside the snowline quickly broadens due to scattering. Our simulation results confirm that this formation pathway indeed leads to similarly-sized planets and is highly efficient in turning pebbles into planets. Our results suggest that the innermost planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system grew mostly by planetesimal accretion at an early time, whereas the outermost planets were initially scattered outwards and grew mostly by pebble accretion. The water content of planets resulting from our simulations is on the order of 10%, and our results predict a \"V-shaped\" trend in the planet water fraction with orbital distance: from relatively high (innermost planets) to relatively low (intermediate planets) to relatively high (outermost planets).",

Recent and upcoming observing missions of exoplanets and stars in the galaxy help to provide constraints on the physics of tidal dissipation. It is timely to develop new N-body codes, which allow for experimentation with various tidal models and numerical implementations. We present the open-source N-body code TIDYMESS, which stands for 'TIdal DYnamics of Multibody ExtraSolar Systems'. This code implements a Creep deformation law for the bodies, parametrized by their fluid Love numbers and fluid relaxation times. Due to tidal and centrifugal deformations, we approximate the general shape of a body to be an ellipsoid. We calculate the associated gravitational field to quadruple order, from which we derive the gravitational accelerations and torques. The equations of motion for the orbits, spins and deformations are integrated directly using a fourth-order integration method based on a symplectic composition. We implement a novel integration method for the deformations, which allows for a time-step solely dependent on the orbits, and not on the spin periods or fluid relaxation times. This feature greatly speeds up the calculations, while also improving the consistency when comparing different tidal regimes. We demonstrate the capabilities and performance of TIDYMESS, particularly in the niche regime of parameter space where orbits are chaotic and tides become non-linear.",

We introduce for that purpose a new open-source addition to the MercuryN-body code, Mercury-T, which takes into account tides, general relativity and the effect of rotation-induced flattening in order to simulate the dynamical and tidal evolution of multi-planet systems. It uses a standard equilibrium tidal model, the constant time lag model. Besides, the evolution of the radius of several host bodies has been implemented (brown dwarfs, M-dwarfs of mass 0.1 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, Sun-like stars, Jupiter). We validate the new code by comparing its output for one-planet systems to the secular equations results. We find that this code does respect the conservation of total angular momentum. We applied this new tool to the planetary system Kepler-62. We find that tides influence the stability of the system in some cases. We also show that while the four inner planets of the systems are likely to have slow rotation rates and small obliquities, the fifth planet could have a fast rotation rate and a high obliquity. This means that the two habitable zone planets of this system, Kepler-62e ad f are likely to have very different climate features, and this of course would influence their potential at hosting surface liquid water. <P />The code is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/583/A116\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/583/A116</A>",

Hot Jupiters orbiting hot stars (\u22736250 K) display a wide range of obliquities, while similar planets orbiting cool stars are preferentially aligned. Tidal dissipation is expected to be more rapid in stars with thick convective envelopes, potentially explaining this trend. Evolved stars provide an opportunity to test the damping hypothesis, particularly stars that were hot on the main sequence and have since cooled and developed deep convective envelopes. We present the first systematic study of the obliquities of hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants that recently developed convective envelopes using Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin observations. Our sample includes two newly discovered systems in the Giants Transiting Giants survey (TOI-6029 b, TOI-4379 b). We find that the orbits of hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants that have cooled below \u223c6250 K are aligned or nearly aligned with the spin axis of their host stars, indicating rapid tidal realignment after the emergence of a stellar convective envelope. We place an upper limit for the timescale of realignment for hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants at \u223c500 Myr. Comparison with a simplified tidal evolution model shows that obliquity damping needs to be \u223c4 orders of magnitude more efficient than orbital period decay to damp the obliquity without destroying the planet, which is consistent with recent predictions for tidal dissipation from inertial waves excited by hot Jupiters on misaligned orbits.",

      "abstract": "Since 20 years, a large population of close-in planets orbiting various classes of low-mass stars (from M-type to A-type stars) has been discovered. In such systems, the dissipation of the kinetic energy of tidal flows in the host star may modify its rotational evolution and shape the orbital architecture of the surrounding planetary system. In this context, recent observational and theoretical works demonstrated that the amplitude of this dissipation can vary over several orders of magnitude as a function of stellar mass, age and rotation. In addition, stellar spin-up occurring during the Pre-Main-Sequence (PMS) phase because of the contraction of stars and their spin-down because of the torque applied by magnetized stellar winds strongly impact angular momentum exchanges within star\u2013planet systems. Therefore, it is now necessary to take into account the structural and rotational evolution of stars when studying the orbital evolution of close-in planets. At the same time, the presence of planets may modify the rotational dynamics of the host stars and as a consequence their evolution, magnetic activity and mixing. In this work, we present the first study of the dynamics of close-in planets of various masses orbiting low-mass stars (from <inline-formula id=\"IEq1\"><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.6</mml:mn><mml:mspace width=\"3.33333pt\"></mml:mspace><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>\u2299</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> to <inline-formula id=\"IEq2\"><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1.2</mml:mn><mml:mspace width=\"3.33333pt\"></mml:mspace><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>\u2299</mml:mo></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) where we compute the simultaneous evolution of the star's structure, rotation and tidal dissipation in its external convective envelope. We demonstrate that tidal friction due to the stellar dynamical tide, i.e. tidal inertial waves excited in the convection zone, can be larger by several orders of magnitude than the one of the equilibrium tide currently used in Celestial Mechanics, especially during the PMS phase. Moreover, because of this stronger tidal friction in the star, the orbital migration of the planet is now more pronounced and depends more on the stellar mass, rotation and age. This would very weakly affect the planets in the habitable zone because they are located at orbital distances such that stellar tide-induced migration happens on very long timescales. We also demonstrate that the rotational evolution of host stars is only weakly affected by the presence of planets except for massive companions.",

      "abstract": "Many extrasolar planets orbit sufficiently close to their host stars that significant tidal interactions can be expected, resulting in an evolution of the spin and orbital properties of the planets. The accompanying dissipation of energy can also be an important source of heat, leading to the inflation of short-period planets and even mass loss through Roche lobe overflow. Tides may therefore play an important role in determining the observed distributions of mass, orbital period, and eccentricity of the extrasolar planets. In addition, tidal interactions between gaseous giant planets in the solar system and their moons are thought to be responsible for the orbital migration of the satellites, leading to their capture into resonant configurations. <P />Traditionally, the efficiency of tidal dissipation is simply parameterized by a quality factor Q, which depends, in principle, in an unknown way on the frequency and amplitude of the tidal forcing. In this paper we treat the underlying fluid dynamical problem with the aim of determining the efficiency of tidal dissipation in gaseous giant planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, or the short-period extrasolar planets. Efficient convection enforces a nearly adiabatic stratification in these bodies, which may or may not contain solid cores. With some modifications, our approach can also be applied to low-mass stars with extended convective envelopes. <P />In cases of interest, the tidal forcing frequencies are typically comparable to the spin frequency of the planet but are small compared to its dynamical frequency. We therefore study the linearized response of a slowly and possibly differentially rotating planet to low-frequency tidal forcing. Convective regions of the planet support inertial waves, which possess a dense or continuous frequency spectrum in the absence of viscosity, while any radiative regions support generalized Hough waves. We formulate the relevant equations for studying the excitation of these disturbances and present a set of illustrative numerical calculations of the tidal dissipation rate. <P />We argue that inertial waves provide a natural avenue for efficient tidal dissipation in most cases of interest. In the presence of a solid core, the excited disturbance tends to be localized on a web of rays rather than resembling a smooth eigenfunction. The resulting value of Q depends, in principle, in a highly erratic way on the forcing frequency, but we provide analytical and numerical evidence that the frequency-averaged dissipation rate may be asymptotically independent of the viscosity in the limit of small Ekman number. For a smaller viscosity, the tidal disturbance has a finer spatial structure and individual resonances are more pronounced. <P />In short-period extrasolar planets, tidal dissipation via inertial waves becomes somewhat less efficient once they are spun down to a synchronous state. However, if the stellar irradiation of the planet leads to the formation of a radiative outer layer that supports generalized Hough modes, the tidal dissipation rate can be enhanced, albeit with significant uncertainty, through the excitation and damping of these waves. The dissipative mechanisms that we describe offer a promising explanation of the historical evolution and current state of the Galilean satellites, as well as the observed circularization of the orbits of short-period extrasolar planets.",

While the tightest-orbit binaries should host the most dynamically stable and long-lived circumbinary planetary systems, they are also the systems that are expected to experience mass transfer, common envelope evolution, or stellar mergers. In this study, we explore the effect of stable non-conservative mass transfer on the dynamical evolution of circumbinary planets. We present a new script that seamlessly integrates binary evolution data from the 1D binary stellar evolution code MESA into the N-body simulation code REBOUND. This integration framework enables a comprehensive examination of the dynamical evolution of circumbinary planets orbiting mass-transferring binaries, while simultaneously accounting for the detailed stellar structure evolution. In addition, we introduce a recalibration method to mitigate numerical errors from updates of binary properties during the system's dynamical evolution. We construct a reference binary model in which a <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"TM0001\" notation=\"LaTeX\">$2.21\\, \\mathrm{ M}_\\odot$</tex-math></inline-formula> star loses its hydrogen-rich envelope through non-conservative mass transfer to the <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"TM0002\" notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.76\\, \\mathrm{ M}_\\odot$</tex-math></inline-formula> companion star, creating a <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"TM0003\" notation=\"LaTeX\">$0.38\\, \\mathrm{ M}_\\odot$</tex-math></inline-formula> subdwarf.

Accounting for tides by using the interior stellar structure, we find that tidal effects become apparent after the rapid mass transfer phase and start to fade away during the latter stage of the slow mass transfer phase. Our research provides a new framework for exploring circumbinary planet dynamics in interacting binary systems.",

      "abstract": "Tidal friction is thought to be important in determining the long-term spin-orbit evolution of short-period extrasolar planetary systems. Using a simple model of the orbit-averaged effects of tidal friction, we study the evolution of close-in planets on inclined orbits, due to tides. We analyse the effects of the inclusion of stellar magnetic braking by performing a phase-plane analysis of a simplified system of equations, including the braking torque. The inclusion of magnetic braking is found to be important, and its neglect can result in a very different system history. We then present the results of numerical integrations of the tidal evolution equations, where we find that it is essential to consider coupled evolution of the orbital and rotational elements, including dissipation in both the star and planet, to accurately model the evolution. <P />The main result of our integrations is that for typical Hot Jupiters, tidal friction aligns the stellar spin with the orbit on a similar time as it causes the orbit to decay. This tells us that if a planet is observed to be aligned, then it probably formed coplanar. This reinforces the importance of Rossiter-McLaughlin effect observations in determining the degree of spin-orbit alignment in transiting systems. <P />We apply these results to the only observed system with a spin-orbit misalignment, XO-3, and constrain the efficiency of tidal dissipation (i.e. the modified tidal quality factors Q') in both the star and the planet in this system. Using a model in which inertial waves are excited by tidal forcing in the outer convective envelope and dissipated by turbulent viscosity, we calculate Q' for a range of F-star models, and find it to vary considerably within this class of stars. This means that using a single Q', and assuming that it applies to all stars, is probably incorrect. In addition, we propose an explanation for the survival of two of the planets on the tightest orbits, WASP-12 b and OGLE-TR-56 b, in terms of weak dissipation in the star, as a result of their internal structures and slow rotation periods.",

      "abstract": "Context. Star-planet interactions must be taken into account in stellar models to understand the dynamical evolution of close-in planets. The dependence of the tidal interactions on the structural and rotational evolution of the star is of particular importance and should be correctly treated. <BR /> Aims: We quantify how tidal dissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from the pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial stellar mass. We investigate the consequences of this evolution on planetary orbital evolution. <BR /> Methods: We couple the tidal dissipation formalism previously described to the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and apply this coupling to rotating stars with masses between 0.3 and 1.4 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. As a first step, this formalism assumes a simplified bi-layer stellar structure with corresponding averaged densities for the radiative core and the convective envelope. We use a frequency-averaged treatment of the dissipation of tidal inertial waves in the convection zone (but neglect the dissipation of tidal gravity waves in the radiation zone). In addition, we generalize a recent work by following the orbital evolution of close-in planets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of stellar evolution. <BR /> Results: On the pre-main sequence the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled by the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the main sequence it is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by magnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the rotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by about four orders of magnitude on the main sequence, compared to a normalized dissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes. <BR /> Conclusions: The evolution of the dissipation strongly depends on the evolution of the internal structure and rotation of the star. From the pre-main sequence up to the tip of the red-giant branch, it varies by several orders of magnitude, with strong consequences for the orbital evolution of close-in massive planets. These effects are the strongest during the pre-main sequence, implying that the planets are mainly sensitive to the star's early history.",

      "abstract": "Recent JWST observations of rocky planets, such as TRAPPIST-1, and the increasing number of rocky planets discovered orbiting close to their host star, strongly motivates the improvement of tidal modeling.Beside, recent JWST observations of the thermal emission from TRAPPIST-1 b and c have provided constraints on their atmospheres (Greene et al. 2023; Ih et al. 2023; Zieba et al. 2023; Lincowski et al. 2023). In this context, It is crucial to use a coherent tidal model that encapsulates the complex response of rocky planets to stress, to understand the evolution of exoplanets and interpret new data.Our presentation will focus on recent developments on the implementation of the formalism of Kaula (1964) in the N-body code Posidonius (Blanco-Cuaresma &amp; Bolmont 2017; Bolmont et al. 2020).This formalism consists in using a decomposition of the tidal potential into Fourier harmonic modes, which allows to account for the frequency dependence of the tidal response of rocky bodies.It makes it general enough to take into account for any type of internal structure, as well as the presence of ice or surface liquid water.We will present our results on the rotational state of TRAPPIST-1 planets, revisiting the assumption of the perfect synchronization state resulting from tidal evolution. Given that the rotational state influences the heat redistribution regime, precise estimation of their rotational state is critical.Various internal structures were explored with the Burnman code (Cottaar et al. 2014; Myhill et al. 2021)., considering compositions and core sizes compatible with mass and radius estimations from Agol et al. (2021).Our simulations showed that planet-planet interactions induce rapid variations in the mean motions of the planets. These variations occur too quickly for tides to maintain synchronized rotation states with the mean motion. This results in sub-stellar point drifts, causing planets to complete full solar days with periods ranging from 42 to 103 years depending on the planet. The competition between mean motion variations and tidal damping, and thus sub-stellar drifts, is contingent on the internal structure of the planet under consideration. As a result, remnant rotation is expected to facilitate the redistribution of heat on the planet's surface, modifying habitability conditions by mitigating the cold-trap effect on the night side (Turbet et al. 2016) and redistributing cloud formation on the day side (Turbet et al. 2021).Additionally, we will present preliminary results on the coupling between the spin and the orbital evolution of planets in compact mean motion resonances (MMRs), in particular with the presence of obliquity spin-orbit resonances (SOR), on time transit variations (TTV) and on the mean motion resonances for the TRAPPIST-1 system and the potential observability of such effects.",

Recent measurements of the TTVs of TRAPPIST-1 have led to an estimate of the masses of the planets, enabling an estimate of their densities and their water content. A recent TTV analysis using data obtained in the past two years yields a 34 and 13% increase in mass for TRAPPIST-1b and c, respectively. In most studies to date, a Newtonian N-body model is used to fit the masses of the planets, while sometimes general relativity is accounted for. Using the Posidonius N-body code, in this paper we show that in the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, non-Newtonian effects might also be relevant to correctly model the dynamics of the system and the resulting TTVs. In particular, using standard values of the tidal Love number k<SUB>2</SUB> (accounting for the tidal deformation) and the fluid Love number k<SUB>2f</SUB> (accounting for the rotational flattening) leads to differences in the TTVs of TRAPPIST-1b and c that are similar to the differences caused by general relativity. We also show that relaxing the values of tidal Love number k<SUB>2</SUB> and the fluid Love number k<SUB>2f</SUB> can lead to TTVs which differ by as much as a few 10 s on a 3-4-yr timescale, which is a potentially observable level. The high values of the Love numbers needed to reach observable levels for the TTVs could be achieved for planets with a liquid ocean, which if detected might then be interpreted as a sign that TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c could have a liquid magma ocean. For TRAPPIST-1 and similar systems the models to fit the TTVs should potentially account for general relativity, for the tidal deformation of the planets, for the rotational deformation of the planets, and to a lesser extent for the rotational deformation of the star, which would add up to 7 \u00d7 2 + 1 = 15 additional free parameters in the case of TRAPPIST-1.",

In this paper we present a scenario for the formation and orbital architecture of the TRAPPIST-1 system. In our model, planet formation starts at the H<SUB>2</SUB>O iceline, where pebble-sized particles whose origin is the outer disk accumulate to trigger streaming instabilities. After their formation, planetary embryos quickly mature by pebble accretion. Planet growth stalls at Earth masses, where the planet's gravitational feedback on the disk keeps pebbles at bay. Planets are transported by type I migration to the inner disk, where they stall at the magnetospheric cavity and end up in mean motion resonances. During disk dispersal, the cavity radius expands and the innermost planets escape resonance. We argue that the model outlined here can also be applied to other compact systems and that the many close-in super-Earth systems are a scaled-up version of TRAPPIST-1. We also hypothesize that few close-in compact systems harbor giant planets at large distances, since they would have stopped the pebble flux from the outer disk.",
