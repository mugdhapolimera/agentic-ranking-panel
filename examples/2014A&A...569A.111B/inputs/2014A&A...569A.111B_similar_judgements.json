  "abstract": "Context. An increasing number of high-resolution stellar spectra is available today thanks to many past and ongoing extensive spectroscopic surveys. Consequently, the scientific community needs automatic procedures to derive atmospheric parameters and individual element abundances. <BR /> Aims: Based on the widely known SPECTRUM code by R.O. Gray, we developed an integrated spectroscopic software framework suitable for the determination of atmospheric parameters (i.e., effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity) and individual chemical abundances. The code, named iSpec and freely distributed, is written mainly in Python and can be used on different platforms. <BR /> Methods: iSpec can derive atmospheric parameters by using the synthetic spectral fitting technique and the equivalent width method. We validated the performance of both approaches by developing two different pipelines and analyzing the Gaia FGK benchmark stars spectral library. The analysis was complemented with several tests designed to assess other aspects, such as the interpolation of model atmospheres and the performance with lower quality spectra. <BR /> Results: We provide a code ready to perform automatic stellar spectral analysis. We successfully assessed the results obtained for FGK stars with high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra. <P />The code is available via <A href=\"http://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/\">http://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/</A>",

      "abstract": "Double-line spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) are a vital class of spectroscopic binaries for studying star formation and evolution. Searching for SB2s has been a hot topic in astronomy. Although considerable efforts have been made with fruitful outcomes, limitations in automation and accuracy still persist. In this study, we developed a convolutional neural network model to search for SB2 candidates in LAMOST medium-resolution survey (MRS) data release (DR) 9 v1.0 by detecting double peaks in the cross-correlation function (CCF). We first generated a large number of spectra of single stars and binaries using the iSpec spectral synthesis software. The CCFs of these synthesized spectra were then calculated to form our training set. To efficiently detect the peaks of the CCFs, we applied a Softmax function-based noise reduction method. After testing and validation, the model achieved an accuracy of 97.76% in the testing set and was validated for more than 90% of the sample in several published SB2 catalogs. Finally, by applying the model to examine approximately 1.59 million LAMOST-MRS DR9 spectra, we identified 728 candidate SB2s, including 281 newly discovered ones.",

      "abstract": "We developed a convolutional neural network model to distinguish the double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) from others based on single-exposure medium-resolution spectra (R ~ 7500). The training set consists of a large set of mock spectra of single stars and binaries synthesized based on the MIST stellar evolutionary model and ATLAS9 atmospheric model. Our model reaches a novel theoretic false-positive rate by adding a proper penalty on the negative sample (e.g., 0.12% and 0.16% for the blue/red arm when the penalty parameter \u039b = 16). Tests show that the performance is as expected and favors FGK-type main-sequence (MS) binaries with high mass ratio (q \u2265 0.7) and large radial velocity separation (\u0394v \u2265 50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). Although the real false-positive rate cannot be estimated reliably, validating on eclipsing binaries identified from Kepler light curves indicates that our model predicts low binary probabilities at eclipsing phases (0, 0.5, and 1.0) as expected. The color-magnitude diagram also helps illustrate its feasibility and capability of identifying FGK MS binaries from spectra. We conclude that this model is reasonably reliable and can provide an automatic approach to identify SB2s with period \u227210 days. This work yields a catalog of binary probabilities for over 5 million spectra of 1 million sources from the LAMOST medium-resolution survey (MRS) and a catalog of 2198 SB2 candidates whose physical properties will be analyzed in a follow-up paper.

      "abstract": "Context. The Gaia-ESO survey (GES) is a large public spectroscopic survey that acquired spectra for more than 100 000 stars across all major components of the Milky Way. In addition to atmospheric parameters and stellar abundances that have been derived in previous papers of this series, the GES spectra allow us to detect spectroscopic binaries with one (SB1), two (SB2), or more (SBn \u2265 3) components. Aims. The present paper discusses the statistics of GES SBn \u2265 2 after analysing 160 727 GIRAFFE HR10 and HR21 spectra, amounting to 37 565 unique Milky Way field targets. Methods. Cross-correlation functions (CCFs) have been re-computed thanks to a dozen spectral masks probing a range of effective temperatures (3900 K &lt; T<SUB>eff</SUB> &lt; 8000 K), surface gravities (1.0 &lt; log g &lt; 4.7), and metallicities (\u20112.6 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0.3). By optimising the mask choice for a given spectrum, the newly computed, so-called NACRE (NArrow CRoss-correlation Experiment) CCFs are narrower and allow more stellar components to be unblended than standard masks. The DOE (Detection Of Extrema) extremum-finding code then selects the individual components and provides their radial velocities. Results. From the sample of HR10 and HR21 spectra corresponding to 37 565 objects, the present study leads to the detection of 322 SB2, ten SB3 (three of them being tentative), and two tentative SB4. In particular, compared to our previous study, the NACRE CCFs allowed us to multiply the number of SB2 candidates by \u22481.5. The colour-magnitude diagram reveals, as expected, the shifted location of the SB2 main sequence. A comparison between the SB identified in Gaia DR3 and the ones detected in the present work was performed and the complementarity of the two censuses is discussed. An application to the mass-ratio determination is presented, and the mass-ratio distribution of the GES SB2 is discussed. When accounting for the SB2 detection rate, an SB2 frequency of \u22481.4 % is derived within the present stellar sample of mainly FGK-type stars. Conclusions. As primary outliers identified within the GES data, SBn spectra produce a wealth of information and useful constraints for the binary population synthesis studies.",

In this work, we present the results of our analysis of medium-resolution LAMOST spectra of late-type candidate members of the Pleiades with the aim of determining the stellar parameters, activity level, and lithium abundance. Methods. We used the ROTFIT code to determine the atmospheric parameters (T<SUB>eff</SUB>, log g, and [Fe/H]), along with the radial velocity (RV) and projected rotation velocity (v sin i). Moreover, for late-type stars (T<SUB>eff</SUB> \u2264 6500 K), we also calculated the H\u03b1 and Li I\u03bb6708 net equivalent width by means of the subtraction of inactive photospheric templates. We also used the rotation periods from the literature and we purposely determined them for 89 stars by analyzing the available Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry. Results. We derived the RV, v sin i, and atmospheric parameters for 1581 spectra of 283 stars. Literature data were used to assess the accuracy of the derived parameters. The RV distribution of the cluster members peaks at 5.0 km s<SUP>\u20111</SUP> with a dispersion of 1.4 km s<SUP>\u20111</SUP>, while the average metallicity is [Fe/H]=\u20110.03\u00b10.06, in line with previous determinations. Fitting empirical isochrones of Li depletion to EW measures of stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> \u2264 6500 K, we obtained a reliable age for the Pleiades of 118\u00b16 Myr, in agreement with the recent literature. The activity indicators H\u03b1 line flux (F<SUB>H\u03b1</SUB>) and luminosity ratio (R<SUP>'</SUP><SUB>H\u03b1</SUB>) show the hottest stars to be less active (on average) than the coldest ones, as expected for a 100-Myr old cluster. When plotted against the Rossby number, R<SUB>O</SUB>, our R<SUP>'</SUP><SUB>H\u03b1</SUB> values display a typical activity-rotation trend, with a steep decay for R<SUB>O</SUB> \u2265 0.2 and a nearly flat (saturated) activity level for smaller values.

For three sources with multi-epoch data, we had access to LAMOST spectra acquired during flares, which are characterized by strong and broad H\u03b1 profiles and the presence of the He I \u03bb6678 \u00c5 emission line. Among our targets, we identified 39 possible SB1 and ten SB2 systems.

The Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) is a large spectroscopic survey that provides a unique opportunity to study the distribution of spectroscopic multiple systems among different populations of the Galaxy. <BR /> Aims: Our aim is to detect binarity/multiplicity for stars targeted by the GES from the analysis of the cross-correlation functions (CCFs) of the GES spectra with spectral templates. <BR /> Methods: We developed a method based on the computation of the CCF successive derivatives to detect multiple peaks and determine their radial velocities, even when the peaks are strongly blended. The parameters of the detection of extrema (DOE) code have been optimized for each GES GIRAFFE and UVES setup to maximize detection. The DOE code therefore allows to automatically detect multiple line spectroscopic binaries (SBn, n \u2265 2). <BR /> Results: We apply this method on the fourth GES internal data release and detect 354 SBn candidates (342 SB2, 11 SB3, and even one SB4), including only nine SBs known in the literature. This implies that about 98% of these SBn candidates are new because of their faint visual magnitude that can reach V = 19. Visual inspection of the SBn candidate spectra reveals that the most probable candidates have indeed a composite spectrum. Among the SB2 candidates, an orbital solution could be computed for two previously unknown binaries: CNAME 06404608+0949173 (known as V642 Mon) in NGC 2264 and CNAME 19013257-0027338 in Berkeley 81 (Be 81). A detailed analysis of the unique SB4 (four peaks in the CCF) reveals that CNAME 08414659-5303449 (HD 74438) in the open cluster IC 2391 is a physically bound stellar quadruple system. The SB candidates belonging to stellar clusters are reviewed in detail to discard false detections. We suggest that atmospheric parameters should not be used for these system components; SB-specific pipelines should be used instead. <BR /> Conclusions: Our implementation of an automatic detection of spectroscopic binaries within the GES has allowed the efficient discovery of many new multiple systems. With the detection of the SB1 candidates that will be the subject of a forthcoming paper, the study of the statistical and physical properties of the spectroscopic multiple systems will soon be possible for the entire GES sample. <P />Based on data products from observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme ID 188.B-3002.

We derive the Ba abundances from three Ba II absorption lines at \u03bb\u03bb5853, 6141, and 6496 \u00c5 of R = 47,000 UVES spectra through the spectral synthesis method using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and NLTE assumptions. Compared to the GES catalog, the LTE Ba abundances obtained by us from the Ba II \u03bb5853 line are the closest to the GES LTE results. The NLTE hypothesis is found to show various impacts on the three lines. The maximum differences from LTE abundances are 0.2, 0.5, and 0.6 dex for the Ba II lines at \u03bb\u03bb5853, 6141, and 6496 \u00c5, respectively. The NLTE corrections present opposite signs around [Fe/H] = \u20112.0 dex for the Ba II line at \u03bb5853. Stars with higher temperatures or higher Ba abundances suffer larger NLTE effects. A more consistent result of the three lines confirms the necessity of taking NLTE effects into account when determining the Ba abundances.",

It is a special reflecting Schmidt telescope with 4000 fibers in a field of view of 20deg<SUP>2</SUP> in the sky. Until July 2019, LAMOST has completed its pilot survey, which was launched in October 2011 and ended in June 2012, and the regular survey of the first seven years, which was initiated on September 2012. In this data release, there are totally 10,431,197 low resolution spectra published, which satisfy the selection criteria that the LAMOST LRS General Catalog also used. The data products of this release can be available from the website http://dr7.lamost.org/v2.0/, and they include <P />1. Spectra. - There are 10,431,197 flux (relatively)- and wavelength-calibrated, sky-subtracted spectra in DR7, including 9,846,793 stellar spectra, 198,272 galaxy spectra, 66,612 quasar spectra, and 319,520 unknown object spectra, and these spectra cover the wavelength range of 3690\u00c5-9100\u00c5 with a resolution of 1800 at the 5500\u00c5. <P />2. Spectroscopic Parameter Catalogs. - In this data release, nine spectroscopic parameter catalogs are also published and they are the LAMOST LRS General Catalog, the LAMOST LRS Stellar Parameter Catalog of A, F, G and K Stars, the LAMOST LRS Line-Index Catalog of A Type Stars, the LAMOST LRS Catalog of gM, dM, and sdM Stars, the LAMOST LRS Multiple Epoch Catalog, the LAMOST LRS Observed Plate Information Catalog, the LAMOST LRS Input Catalog, the LAMOST LRS Catalog of Cataclysmic Variable Stars, and the LAMOST LRS Catalog of White Dwarf Stars respectively. Tens of parameters are included in these catalogs, such as right ascension, declination, signal to noise ratio (S/N), magnitude, gaia<SUB>source</SUB>id, gaia<SUB>g</SUB>mean_mag, atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity), radial velocity, element abundance, spectral line indices, line widths, the metallicity sensitive parameter, and the magnetic activity flag. <P />Data Release One of LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (MRS). <P />The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) is a Chinese national scientific research facility operated by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is a special reflecting Schmidt telescope with 4000 fibers in a field of view of 20 deg<SUP>2</SUP> in the sky. Since October 2018, LAMOST started the second stage survey program (LAMOST II), which contains both low- and medium-resolution spectroscopic surveys. LAMOST II takes about 50% nights (dark/gray nights) to continue the previous low-resolution spectroscopic survey, and another 50% nights (bright/gray nights) to conduct the medium-resolution survey (MRS). For LAMOST MRS, it includes two surveys, i.e., the time-domain and the non time-domain surveys. The main purpose of the time-domain survey is to investigate variable targets, which were repeatedly observed in several observation nights, but targets of the non time-domain survey were observed only in one night in general. <P />This time, 11,190,570 single exposure spectra and 2,906,397 coadded spectra were obtained, which were written into 1,498,289 FITS files. For objects close to the moon, spectra may be affected by the moon, thus targets with the angular distances to the moon less than 10 degrees were not observed. For the non time-domain survey, there are totally 988,188 coadded spectra published, and for the time-domain survey, 2,828,655 single exposure spectra were released. The data products of this data release can be available from the website http://dr7.lamost.org/v2.0/, and they include <P />1. Spectra. - For a target of MRS, we can get two spectra within an exposure, including a blue (B) and a red (R) band spectrum, and their wavelength ranges are [4950\u00c5, 5350\u00c5] and [6300\u00c5, 6800\u00c5], respectively. Generally, each object was observed several times, and we would obtain the coadded B and R band spectra by combing the single exposure spectra. Few targets, however, lack of the spectral data of either band for some reason like the wavelength calibration, only one even no coadded spectra exists in their FITS file. For single exposure and coadd spectra, they both have a resolution of 7500 respectively at 5163\u00c5 (blue) and 6593\u00c5 (red). <P />2. Spectroscopic Parameter Catalogs. - In this data release, four spectroscopic parameter catalogs are published, and they are the LAMOST MRS General Catalog, the LAMOST MRS Parameter Catalog, the LAMOST MRS Observed Plate Information Catalog, and the LAMOST MRS Input Catalog, respectively. LAMOST targets were cross-matched with Gaia DR2 catalog, and their Gaia source identifiers and G magnitudes are included in two LAMOST MRS catalogs except the LAMOST MRS Observed Plate Information Catalog and the LAMOST MRS Input Catalog. <P />(11 data files).",

      "abstract": "Lithium is a fragile but crucial chemical element in the Universe, and exhibits interesting and complex behaviors. Thanks to the mass of spectroscopic data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) medium-resolution survey (MRS), we can investigate the lithium abundances in a large and diverse sample of stars, which could bring vital help in studying the origin and evolution of lithium. In this work, we use the Li I 6707.8 \u00c5 line to derive the lithium abundance through a template-matching method. A catalog of precise lithium abundance is presented for 795,384 spectra corresponding to 455,752 stars from the LAMOST MRS Data Release 9. Comparing our results with those of external high-resolution references, we find good consistency with a typical deviation of \u03c3 A(Li) \u223c 0.2 dex. We also analyze the internal errors using stars that have multiple LAMOST MRS observations, which will reach as low as 0.1 dex when the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra is &gt;20. Besides, our result indicates that a small fraction of giant stars still exhibit a surprisingly high lithium content, and 967 stars are identified as Li-rich giants with A(Li) &gt; 1.5 dex, accounting for \u223c2.6% of our samples. If one takes into account the fact that nearly all stars deplete lithium during the main sequence, then the fraction of Li-rich stars may far exceed 2.6%. This new catalog covers a wide range of stellar evolutionary stages from pre-main sequence to giants, and will provide help to the further study of the chemical evolution of lithium.",

      "abstract": "The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) has obtained more than 23 million spectra, opening an unprecedented opportunity to study stellar physics, as well as the formation and evolution of our Milky Way. In order to obtain the accurate stellar parameters, we develop a LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectral Analysis Pipeline (LAMA), which estimates the stellar parameters from the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra, including the effective temperature (T <SUB>eff</SUB>), surface gravity ( ), metallicity ([Fe/H]), radial velocity, and rotational velocity ( ). LAMA estimates these parameters utilizing the template-matching method. The comparison between our results and those from the high-resolution ones, including APOGEE, GALAH, and PASTEL, shows no obvious bias, indicating the reliability of our results. The accuracy of T <SUB>eff</SUB> and [Fe/H] can reach 75 K and 0.12 dex, respectively, for the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (MRS) spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 10. For dwarfs, the uncertainty of is around 0.17 dex, while, for giants, it ranges from 0.18 to 0.30 dex, with the errors decreasing as increases. Using LAMA for the LAMOST-MRS spectra, we estimate the stellar parameters of 497,412 stars. This sample will be very helpful for investigating the formation and evolution of our Galaxy.",
