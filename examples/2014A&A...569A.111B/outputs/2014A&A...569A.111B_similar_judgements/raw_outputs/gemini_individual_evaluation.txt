While it uses iSpec, it does not focus on the capabilities or validation of iSpec itself, but rather on the application of a deep learning model, so it is somewhat relevant."

It uses a training set of mock spectra synthesized using the MIST stellar evolutionary model and ATLAS9 atmospheric model and does not use or mention iSpec, so it is somewhat relevant but tangential to the main paper."
