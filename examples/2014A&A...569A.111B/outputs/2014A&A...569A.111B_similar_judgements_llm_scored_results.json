    "Determining stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of FGK stars with iSpec"
  ],
  "abstract": "Context. An increasing number of high-resolution stellar spectra is available today thanks to many past and ongoing extensive spectroscopic surveys. Consequently, the scientific community needs automatic procedures to derive atmospheric parameters and individual element abundances. <BR /> Aims: Based on the widely known SPECTRUM code by R.O. Gray, we developed an integrated spectroscopic software framework suitable for the determination of atmospheric parameters (i.e., effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity) and individual chemical abundances. The code, named iSpec and freely distributed, is written mainly in Python and can be used on different platforms. <BR /> Methods: iSpec can derive atmospheric parameters by using the synthetic spectral fitting technique and the equivalent width method. We validated the performance of both approaches by developing two different pipelines and analyzing the Gaia FGK benchmark stars spectral library. The analysis was complemented with several tests designed to assess other aspects, such as the interpolation of model atmospheres and the performance with lower quality spectra. <BR /> Results: We provide a code ready to perform automatic stellar spectral analysis. We successfully assessed the results obtained for FGK stars with high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra. <P />The code is available via <A href=\"http://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/\">http://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/</A>",

      "abstract": "Double-line spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) are a vital class of spectroscopic binaries for studying star formation and evolution. Searching for SB2s has been a hot topic in astronomy. Although considerable efforts have been made with fruitful outcomes, limitations in automation and accuracy still persist. In this study, we developed a convolutional neural network model to search for SB2 candidates in LAMOST medium-resolution survey (MRS) data release (DR) 9 v1.0 by detecting double peaks in the cross-correlation function (CCF). We first generated a large number of spectra of single stars and binaries using the iSpec spectral synthesis software. The CCFs of these synthesized spectra were then calculated to form our training set. To efficiently detect the peaks of the CCFs, we applied a Softmax function-based noise reduction method. After testing and validation, the model achieved an accuracy of 97.76% in the testing set and was validated for more than 90% of the sample in several published SB2 catalogs. Finally, by applying the model to examine approximately 1.59 million LAMOST-MRS DR9 spectra, we identified 728 candidate SB2s, including 281 newly discovered ones.",

      "abstract": "We developed a convolutional neural network model to distinguish the double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) from others based on single-exposure medium-resolution spectra (R ~ 7500). The training set consists of a large set of mock spectra of single stars and binaries synthesized based on the MIST stellar evolutionary model and ATLAS9 atmospheric model. Our model reaches a novel theoretic false-positive rate by adding a proper penalty on the negative sample (e.g., 0.12% and 0.16% for the blue/red arm when the penalty parameter \u039b = 16). Tests show that the performance is as expected and favors FGK-type main-sequence (MS) binaries with high mass ratio (q \u2265 0.7) and large radial velocity separation (\u0394v \u2265 50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). Although the real false-positive rate cannot be estimated reliably, validating on eclipsing binaries identified from Kepler light curves indicates that our model predicts low binary probabilities at eclipsing phases (0, 0.5, and 1.0) as expected. The color-magnitude diagram also helps illustrate its feasibility and capability of identifying FGK MS binaries from spectra. We conclude that this model is reasonably reliable and can provide an automatic approach to identify SB2s with period \u227210 days. This work yields a catalog of binary probabilities for over 5 million spectra of 1 million sources from the LAMOST medium-resolution survey (MRS) and a catalog of 2198 SB2 candidates whose physical properties will be analyzed in a follow-up paper.

      "abstract": "Context. The Gaia-ESO survey (GES) is a large public spectroscopic survey that acquired spectra for more than 100 000 stars across all major components of the Milky Way. In addition to atmospheric parameters and stellar abundances that have been derived in previous papers of this series, the GES spectra allow us to detect spectroscopic binaries with one (SB1), two (SB2), or more (SBn \u2265 3) components. Aims. The present paper discusses the statistics of GES SBn \u2265 2 after analysing 160 727 GIRAFFE HR10 and HR21 spectra, amounting to 37 565 unique Milky Way field targets. Methods. Cross-correlation functions (CCFs) have been re-computed thanks to a dozen spectral masks probing a range of effective temperatures (3900 K &lt; T<SUB>eff</SUB> &lt; 8000 K), surface gravities (1.0 &lt; log g &lt; 4.7), and metallicities (\u20112.6 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0.3). By optimising the mask choice for a given spectrum, the newly computed, so-called NACRE (NArrow CRoss-correlation Experiment) CCFs are narrower and allow more stellar components to be unblended than standard masks. The DOE (Detection Of Extrema) extremum-finding code then selects the individual components and provides their radial velocities. Results. From the sample of HR10 and HR21 spectra corresponding to 37 565 objects, the present study leads to the detection of 322 SB2, ten SB3 (three of them being tentative), and two tentative SB4. In particular, compared to our previous study, the NACRE CCFs allowed us to multiply the number of SB2 candidates by \u22481.5. The colour-magnitude diagram reveals, as expected, the shifted location of the SB2 main sequence. A comparison between the SB identified in Gaia DR3 and the ones detected in the present work was performed and the complementarity of the two censuses is discussed. An application to the mass-ratio determination is presented, and the mass-ratio distribution of the GES SB2 is discussed. When accounting for the SB2 detection rate, an SB2 frequency of \u22481.4 % is derived within the present stellar sample of mainly FGK-type stars. Conclusions. As primary outliers identified within the GES data, SBn spectra produce a wealth of information and useful constraints for the binary population synthesis studies.",

In this work, we present the results of our analysis of medium-resolution LAMOST spectra of late-type candidate members of the Pleiades with the aim of determining the stellar parameters, activity level, and lithium abundance. Methods. We used the ROTFIT code to determine the atmospheric parameters (T<SUB>eff</SUB>, log g, and [Fe/H]), along with the radial velocity (RV) and projected rotation velocity (v sin i). Moreover, for late-type stars (T<SUB>eff</SUB> \u2264 6500 K), we also calculated the H\u03b1 and Li I\u03bb6708 net equivalent width by means of the subtraction of inactive photospheric templates. We also used the rotation periods from the literature and we purposely determined them for 89 stars by analyzing the available Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry. Results. We derived the RV, v sin i, and atmospheric parameters for 1581 spectra of 283 stars. Literature data were used to assess the accuracy of the derived parameters. The RV distribution of the cluster members peaks at 5.0 km s<SUP>\u20111</SUP> with a dispersion of 1.4 km s<SUP>\u20111</SUP>, while the average metallicity is [Fe/H]=\u20110.03\u00b10.06, in line with previous determinations. Fitting empirical isochrones of Li depletion to EW measures of stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> \u2264 6500 K, we obtained a reliable age for the Pleiades of 118\u00b16 Myr, in agreement with the recent literature. The activity indicators H\u03b1 line flux (F<SUB>H\u03b1</SUB>) and luminosity ratio (R<SUP>'</SUP><SUB>H\u03b1</SUB>) show the hottest stars to be less active (on average) than the coldest ones, as expected for a 100-Myr old cluster. When plotted against the Rossby number, R<SUB>O</SUB>, our R<SUP>'</SUP><SUB>H\u03b1</SUB> values display a typical activity-rotation trend, with a steep decay for R<SUB>O</SUB> \u2265 0.2 and a nearly flat (saturated) activity level for smaller values. However, we still see a slight dependence on R<SUB>O</SUB> in the saturated regime, which is well fitted by a power law with a slope of \u20111.18 \u00b1 0.02; this is in agreement with a number of previous works. For three sources with multi-epoch data, we had access to LAMOST spectra acquired during flares, which are characterized by strong and broad H\u03b1 profiles and the presence of the He I \u03bb6678 \u00c5 emission line. Among our targets, we identified 39 possible SB1 and ten SB2 systems. We have also shown the potential of the LAMOST-MRS spectra in allowing us to refine the orbital solution of a number of binaries and to discover a new double-lined binary as well.",

The domain-adaptation method, CYCLE-STARNET, is employed to reduce the gap between observed and synthetic spectra, and the L-BFGS algorithm is used to search the best-fit synthetic spectra. By combining the Two Micron All Sky Survey photometric survey data, Gaia EDR3 parallax, and MIST isochrones, the surface gravities of the stars are constrained after estimating their bolometric luminosities. The accuracy of T <SUB>eff</SUB>, log g, and [Fe/H] can reach 150 K, 0.11 dex, and 0.15 dex, evaluated by the PASTEL catalog, asteroseismic samples, and other spectroscopic surveys. The precision of these parameters and elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Cr/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Co/Fe], [Ni/Fe], and [Cu/Fe]) is assessed by repeated observations and validated by cluster members. For spectra with signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns) greater than 10, the precision of the three stellar parameters and elemental abundances can achieve 76 K, 0.014 dex, 0.096 dex, and 0.04-0.15 dex.

      "abstract": "Context. The Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) is a large spectroscopic survey that provides a unique opportunity to study the distribution of spectroscopic multiple systems among different populations of the Galaxy. <BR /> Aims: Our aim is to detect binarity/multiplicity for stars targeted by the GES from the analysis of the cross-correlation functions (CCFs) of the GES spectra with spectral templates. <BR /> Methods: We developed a method based on the computation of the CCF successive derivatives to detect multiple peaks and determine their radial velocities, even when the peaks are strongly blended. The parameters of the detection of extrema (DOE) code have been optimized for each GES GIRAFFE and UVES setup to maximize detection. The DOE code therefore allows to automatically detect multiple line spectroscopic binaries (SBn, n \u2265 2). <BR /> Results: We apply this method on the fourth GES internal data release and detect 354 SBn candidates (342 SB2, 11 SB3, and even one SB4), including only nine SBs known in the literature. This implies that about 98% of these SBn candidates are new because of their faint visual magnitude that can reach V = 19. Visual inspection of the SBn candidate spectra reveals that the most probable candidates have indeed a composite spectrum. Among the SB2 candidates, an orbital solution could be computed for two previously unknown binaries: CNAME 06404608+0949173 (known as V642 Mon) in NGC 2264 and CNAME 19013257-0027338 in Berkeley 81 (Be 81). A detailed analysis of the unique SB4 (four peaks in the CCF) reveals that CNAME 08414659-5303449 (HD 74438) in the open cluster IC 2391 is a physically bound stellar quadruple system. The SB candidates belonging to stellar clusters are reviewed in detail to discard false detections. We suggest that atmospheric parameters should not be used for these system components; SB-specific pipelines should be used instead. <BR /> Conclusions: Our implementation of an automatic detection of spectroscopic binaries within the GES has allowed the efficient discovery of many new multiple systems. With the detection of the SB1 candidates that will be the subject of a forthcoming paper, the study of the statistical and physical properties of the spectroscopic multiple systems will soon be possible for the entire GES sample. <P />Based on data products from observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme ID 188.B-3002. These data products have been processed by the Cambridge Astronomy Survey Unit (CASU) at the Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge, and by the FLAMES/UVES reduction team at INAF/Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri.

In this study, we aim to establish a reference sample with high-resolution spectra and high-quality stellar parameters from the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES). This sample explores the non\u2013local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects on the Ba abundances and will support future measurements of Ba abundances for the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) medium-resolution survey (MRS). The sample is composed of 85 common stars of LAMOST MRS DR9 and GES DR5.1, complemented by four metal-poor ([Fe/H] &lt; \u20111 dex) stars from AMBRE-UVES.

For LAMOST MRS, it includes two surveys, i.e., the time-domain and the non time-domain surveys. The main purpose of the time-domain survey is to investigate variable targets, which were repeatedly observed in several observation nights, but targets of the non time-domain survey were observed only in one night in general. <P />This time, 11,190,570 single exposure spectra and 2,906,397 coadded spectra were obtained, which were written into 1,498,289 FITS files.

For the non time-domain survey, there are totally 988,188 coadded spectra published, and for the time-domain survey, 2,828,655 single exposure spectra were released.

In this work, we use the Li I 6707.8 \u00c5 line to derive the lithium abundance through a template-matching method. A catalog of precise lithium abundance is presented for 795,384 spectra corresponding to 455,752 stars from the LAMOST MRS Data Release 9. Comparing our results with those of external high-resolution references, we find good consistency with a typical deviation of \u03c3 A(Li) \u223c 0.2 dex. We also analyze the internal errors using stars that have multiple LAMOST MRS observations, which will reach as low as 0.1 dex when the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra is &gt;20. Besides, our result indicates that a small fraction of giant stars still exhibit a surprisingly high lithium content, and 967 stars are identified as Li-rich giants with A(Li) &gt; 1.5 dex, accounting for \u223c2.6% of our samples. If one takes into account the fact that nearly all stars deplete lithium during the main sequence, then the fraction of Li-rich stars may far exceed 2.6%.

The abundance precision of 11 elements including [C/H], [N/H], [O/H], [Mg/H], [Al/H], [Si/H], [S/H], [Ca/H], [Ti/H], [Cr/H], [Fe/H], and [Ni/H] are 0.06 \u223c 0.12 dex, while that of [Cu/H] is 0.19 dex. These precisions can be reached even for spectra with signal-to-noise ratios as low as 10. The results of SPCANet are consistent with those from other surveys such as APOGEE, GALAH, and RAVE, and are also validated with the previous literature values including clusters and field stars. The catalog of the estimated parameters is available at doi:10.12149/101012.",
