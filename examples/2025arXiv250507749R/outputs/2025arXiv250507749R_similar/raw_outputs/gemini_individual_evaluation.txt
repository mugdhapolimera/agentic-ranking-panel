        "1": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant. It directly addresses the main paper's focus on distinguishing between AGN and ULXs in dwarf galaxies, considering the impact of metallicity. The use of photoionization models and the discussion of specific emission lines (He II, O I) align closely with the main paper's methodology and findings. It expands on the topic by considering the effects of post-starburst age."},
        "2": {"score": 1, "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant. It discusses AGN identification in high-redshift galaxies using JWST, which is related to the broader theme of AGN searches. However, it focuses on higher-mass black holes and doesn't specifically address the challenges of IMBH identification or the confusion with ULXs in metal-poor dwarf galaxies, making it tangential to the main paper's core focus."},
        "3": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant. It directly addresses the main paper's topic by investigating emission line diagnostics for IMBHs in dwarf galaxies, considering physical uncertainties like geometry and AGN SED shapes. The mention of optical and mid-IR diagnostics aligns well with the main paper's exploration of these wavelength ranges. The discussion of degeneracies and the provision of new mid-IR diagnostic diagrams makes it highly relevant."},
        "4": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant. It discusses the identification of IMBHs as low-luminosity AGN, which is related to the main paper's focus. However, it doesn't delve into the specific challenges of distinguishing IMBHs from ULXs or the impact of metallicity on emission lines, making it less directly aligned with the main paper's methodology."},
        "5": {"score": 1, "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant. It discusses the potential observational signatures of IMBHs in AGN discs, which is related to the broader theme of IMBH detection. However, it focuses on IMBHs within larger AGN discs rather than the specific context of dwarf galaxies and the confusion with ULXs, making it tangential to the main paper's core focus."},
        "6": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant. It focuses on searching for IMBHs in Green Pea galaxies, which are luminous compact dwarf galaxies. While it identifies a sample of IMBH candidates, it doesn't specifically address the challenges of distinguishing them from ULXs or the impact of metallicity on emission lines, making it less directly aligned with the main paper's methodology."},
        "7": {"score": 1, "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant. It discusses black hole scaling relations in the dwarf galaxy regime, which is related to the main paper's broader context. However, it doesn't directly address the challenges of distinguishing IMBHs from ULXs or the impact of metallicity on emission lines, making it tangential to the main paper's core focus. It focuses more on BH formation scenarios."},
        "8": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant. It directly addresses the main paper's topic by testing IMBH selection diagnostics for the JWST era, considering the contamination from X-ray binaries in metal-poor, star-forming galaxies. The use of photoionization simulations and the focus on emission line diagnostics align closely with the main paper's methodology. It specifically mentions calibrating diagnostics with time- and metallicity-dependent effects of stars and XRBs."},
        "9": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant. It explores the ionization source in a high-z analog BCD, considering the potential contribution of an IMBH. While it discusses the limitations of current models in predicting high-ionization emission lines in low-metallicity environments, it doesn't fully address the specific challenges of distinguishing IMBHs from ULXs as thoroughly as some other results."},
        "10": {"score": 0, "explanation": "This result is not relevant. It provides a census of ULXs in the local Universe but doesn't focus on the challenges of distinguishing them from IMBHs or the specific context of dwarf galaxies. It is simply a catalog of ULXs."}

            "Some results (2, 5, 7, 10) are only tangentially related to the main paper's specific focus, addressing broader themes of AGN identification or black hole scaling relations without delving into the challenges of IMBH/ULX confusion in dwarf galaxies.",
            "Not all results adequately address the interplay between stellar and AGN excitation, a key aspect of the main paper.",

            "Future research should prioritize the development of robust emission line diagnostics that can effectively distinguish between IMBHs and ULXs in metal-poor dwarf galaxies, considering the time-dependent impact of stars and XRBs.",
            "More studies are needed to explore the impact of different AGN SED shapes and gas cloud geometries on emission line ratios in dwarf galaxies.",
            "Further investigation is warranted into the potential of mid-IR emission lines for IMBH identification with JWST.",
            "Future work should focus on detailed modeling of the physical processes in dwarf galaxies to better understand their emission line spectra and to improve the accuracy of IMBH selection techniques."
