      "Results 1, 3, 8, and 9 directly address the main paper's core focus on emission line diagnostics, ULX contamination, and photoionization models.",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Several results (5, 7, 10) focus on tangential topics (dynamical signatures, ULX demographics) without linking to diagnostic challenges.",
      "Limited discussion of mid-IR diagnostics in some relevant papers (e.g., Result 6)."

    "suggestions": [
      "Prioritize studies that explicitly model emission line diagnostics in metal-poor environments and compare IMBH vs. ULX contributions.",
      "Include more work on mid-IR diagnostics (e.g., [O IV], [Ar II]) for JWST applications.",
      "Explore papers discussing systematic biases in combining multi-wavelength data (X-ray, optical, IR) for IMBH identification."
