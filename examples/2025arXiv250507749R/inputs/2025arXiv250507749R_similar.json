  "title": "Emission Line Diagnostics for IMBHs in Dwarf Galaxies: Accounting for BH Seeding and ULX Excitation",
  "abstract": "Dwarf AGN serve as the ideal systems for identifying intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) down to the most elusive regimes ($\\sim 10^3 - 10^4 M_{\\odot}$). However, the ubiquitously metal-poor nature of dwarf galaxies gives rise to ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that can mimic the spectral signatures of IMBH excitation. We present a novel photoionization model suite that simultaneously incorporates IMBHs and ULXs in a metal-poor, highly star-forming environment. We account for changes in $M_{BH}$ according to formation seeding channels and metallicity, and changes in ULX populations with post-starburst age and metallicity. We find that broadband X-rays and UV emission lines are insensitive to $M_{BH}$ and largely unable to distinguish between ULXs and IMBHs. Many optical diagnostic diagrams cannot correctly identify dwarf AGN. The notable exceptions include He~II~$\u03bb$4686 and [O~I]~$\u03bb$6300, for which we redefine typical demarcations to account for ULX contributions. Emission lines in the mid-IR show the most promise in separating stellar, ULX, IMBH, and shock excitation while presenting sensitivity to $M_{BH}$ and $f_{\\text{AGN}}$. Overall, our results expose the potential biases in identifying and characterizing dwarf AGN purely on strong line ratios and diagnostic diagrams rather than holistically evaluating the entire spectrum. As a proof of concept, we argue that recently discovered over-massive BHs in high-$z$ JWST AGN might not represent the overall BH population, with many galaxies in these samples potentially being falsely classified as purely star-forming.",

      "title": "Distinguishing between Active Galactic Nuclei and Ultra Luminous X-Ray Sources in Dwarf Galaxies",
      "abstract": "Galaxy scaling relationships such as the stellar mass and nuclear black hole (BH) mass relationship imply that galaxies and BHs co-evolve. Our project seeks to understand low-z, low mass (dwarf) galaxies, which serve as laboratories for early universe galaxies, to infer conclusions about nuclear BH growth. While stellar-mass BHs and SMBHs are commonly identified, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) (10<SUP>3</SUP> - 10<SUP>5</SUP> solar masses) thought to reside in dwarf galaxies, remain elusive. Compared to SMBHs, the small sizes and similarly large distances from Earth make dynamic IMBH detections difficult, so active galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures provide an easier way to locate them in dwarf galaxies. However, dwarf galaxies also contain other X-ray emitters, such as ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), that can mimic the signatures expected from dwarf AGN. We use self-consistent photoionization models of dwarf galaxies as a function of post-starburst age and metallicity, which include spectral contributions from stars, AGN, and ULXs, to quantify each source's contribution to the composite spectral energy distribution (SED). Analysis of the photoionization models shows that at solar metallicity, an AGN fraction of 0.04 is enough to completely mask any contribution from ULXs at energies above 54 eV. However, dwarf galaxies are ubiquitously metal-poor. Our models show that at sub-solar metallicities, ULXs continue to influence the ionizing spectrum above 54 eV until the AGN fraction reaches 16%. These findings have implications for emission line diagnostics, such as He II 1640 A, He II 4686 A, and O I 6300 A, to distinguish between AGN and ULX contributions in dwarf galaxies at various metallicities. Our results suggest that sources with strong He II or O I emission, or with an inferred AGN fraction greater than 0.16, should be subject to minimal ULX contamination. These results also have implications for recent JWST observations that show high-z galaxies with O I and He II rest-frame optical spectra. Using our results, researchers with access to high-z JWST observations can constrain the light contribution differences between AGN and ULXs, in the search for IMBHs.",

      "abstract": "Spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope has opened the possibility of identifying moderate-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe, at and beyond the epoch of re-ionisation, complementing previous surveys of much more luminous (and much rarer) quasars. We present 12 new AGNs at 4 &lt; z &lt; 7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z = 10.6) revealed through the detection of a broad-line region (BLR) seen in the Balmer emission lines. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower-mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases, we find evidence for two broad components of H\u03b1, which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs), although a complex BLR geometry cannot be excluded. The inferred BH masses range from 8 \u00d7 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> down to 4 \u00d7 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, interestingly probing the regime expected for direct collapse BHs. The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities (\u223c10<SUP>44</SUP> \u2011 10<SUP>45</SUP> erg/s) imply accretion rates that are &lt; 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BHs, with M<SUB>BH</SUB> \u223c 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BHs at z \u223c 4\u201311 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies' stellar masses when compared to the local M<SUB>BH</SUB> \u2011 M<SUB>star</SUB> relation, even approaching M<SUB>BH</SUB> \u223c M<SUB>star</SUB>, as was expected from heavy BH seeds and/or super-Eddington accretion scenarios. However, we find that these early BHs tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M<SUB>BH</SUB> and velocity dispersion, as well as between M<SUB>BH</SUB> and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the classical, optical narrow-line excitation-diagnostic diagrams, these AGNs are located in the region that is locally occupied by star-forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what is expected for AGNs hosted in metal-poor galaxies (Z \u223c 0.1 \u2011 0.2 Z<SUB>\u2299</SUB>). The fraction of broad-line AGNs with L<SUB>AGN</SUB> &gt; 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg/s among galaxies in the redshift range of 4 &lt; z &lt; 6 is about 10%, suggesting that the contribution of AGNs and their hosts to the re-ionisation of the Universe is &gt; 10%.",

Dwarf galaxies present an opportunity to reveal active IMBHs amidst persistent star formation. We introduce photoionization simulations tailored to address key physical uncertainties: coincident versus noncoincident mixing of IMBH and starlight excitation, open versus closed geometries of surrounding gas clouds, and different shapes of the spectral energy distribution of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We examine possible AGN emission line diagnostics in the optical and mid-IR, and find that the diagnostics are often degenerate with respect to the investigated physical uncertainties. In spite of these setbacks, and in contrast to recent work, we are able to show that [O III]/H\u03b2 typically remains bright for dwarf AGN powered by IMBHs down to 10<SUP>3</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>. Dwarf AGN are predicted to have inconsistent star-forming and Seyfert/LINER classifications using the most common optical diagnostics. In the mid-IR, [O IV] 25.9 \u03bcm and [Ar II] 6.98 \u03bcm are less sensitive to physical uncertainties than are optical diagnostics. Based on these emission lines, we provide several diagrams of mid-IR emission line diagnostic diagrams with demarcations for separating starbursts and AGN with varying levels of activity. The diagrams are valid over a wide range of ionization parameters and metallicities out to z ~ 0.1, so will prove useful for future JWST observations of local dwarf AGN in the search for IMBHs.

      "abstract": "Nearly every massive galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in its nucleus. SMBH masses are millions to billions of solar mass, and they correlate with properties of spheroids of their host galaxies. While the SMBH growth channels, mergers, and gas accretion are well established, their origin remains uncertain: they could have emerged either from massive \u201cseeds\u201d (10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) formed by direct collapse of gas clouds in the early universe or from smaller (100 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) BHs, end products of first stars. The latter channel would leave behind numerous intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs, 10<SUP>2</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>). Although many IMBH candidates have been identified, none are accepted as definitive; thus, their very existence is still debated. Using data mining in wide-field sky surveys and applying dedicated analysis to archival and follow-up optical spectra, we identified a sample of 305 IMBH candidates having masses 3\u00d7 {10}<SUP>4</SUP> {M}<SUB>\u2299 </SUB>&lt; {M}<SUB>BH</SUB>}&lt; 2\u00d7 {10}<SUP>5</SUP> {M}<SUB>\u2299 </SUB>, which reside in galaxy centers and are accreting gas that creates characteristic signatures of a type I active galactic nucleus (AGN). We confirmed the AGN nature of 10 sources (including five previously known objects that validate our method) by detecting the X-ray emission from their accretion disks, thus defining the first bona fide sample of IMBHs in galactic nuclei. All IMBH host galaxies possess small bulges and sit on the low-mass extension of the {M}<SUB>BH</SUB>}{--}{M}<SUB>bulge</SUB>} scaling relation, suggesting that they must have experienced very few if any major mergers over their lifetime. The very existence of nuclear IMBHs supports the stellar-mass seed scenario of the massive BH formation.",

      "abstract": "If intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) grow efficiently in gas discs around supermassive black holes, their host active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs should exhibit myriad observational signatures. Gap-opening IMBHs in AGN discs can exhibit spectral features and variability analogous to gapped protoplanetary discs. A gap-opening IMBH in the innermost disc imprints ripples and oscillations on the broad Fe K\u03b1 line which may be detectable with future X-ray missions. A non-gap-opening IMBH will accrete and produce a soft X-ray excess relative to continuum emission. An IMBH on a retrograde orbit in an AGN disc will not open a gap and will generate soft X-rays from a bow-shock `headwind'. Accreting IMBH in a large cavity can generate ULX-like X-ray luminosities and LINER-like optical line ratios from local ionized gas. We propose that many LINERs house a weakly accreting MBH binary in a large central disc cavity and will be luminous sources of gravitational waves (GW). IMBHs in galactic nuclei may also be detected via intermittent observational signatures including: UV/X-ray flares due to tidal disruption events, asymmetric X-ray intensity distributions as revealed by AGN transits, quasi-periodic oscillations and underluminous Type Ia supernovae. GW emitted during IMBH inspiral and collisions may be detected with eLISA and LIGO, particularly from LINERs.

      "abstract": "The discovery of fast moving stars in Milky Way's most massive globular cluster, \u03c9Centauri (\u03c9Cen), has provided strong evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). However, \u03c9Cen is known to be the stripped nuclear star cluster (NSC) of an ancient, now-destroyed, dwarf galaxy. The best candidate to be the original host progenitor of \u03c9Cen is the tidally disrupted dwarf Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE), a former Milky Way satellite as massive as the Large Magellanic Cloud. I compare \u03c9Cen/GSE with other central BH hosts and place it within the broader context of BH\u2013galaxy (co)evolution. The IMBH of \u03c9Cen/GSE follows the scaling relation between central BH mass and host stellar mass (M<SUB>BH</SUB>\u2013M<SUB>\u22c6</SUB>) extrapolated from local massive galaxies (M<SUB>\u22c6</SUB> \u2273 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>). Therefore, the IMBH of \u03c9Cen/GSE suggests that this relation extends to the dwarf-galaxy regime. I verify that \u03c9Cen (GSE), as well as other NSCs with candidate IMBHs and ultracompact galaxies also follow the M<SUB>BH</SUB>\u2013\u03c3<SUB>\u22c6</SUB> relation with stellar velocity dispersion.

      "abstract": "Understanding the demographics of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) is critical to unraveling the seeding mechanism behind the formation of supermassive black holes. However, the search for IMBHs has proved difficult, in part because black holes in this mass range may be located preferentially in dwarf galaxies, which are typically more metal-poor and have more recent bursts of star formation than more massive galaxies. For IMBH searches at X-ray wavelengths, luminous X-ray binaries (XRBs) can be a contaminating factor, as XRBs form efficiently in low-metallicity, star-forming galaxies. Nebular emission line diagnostics can help with the search for IMBHs, but the selection diagnostics must be calibrated from photoionization simulations that carefully consider the time- and metallicity-dependent impact of stars and XRBs on the observed emission lines. To that end, we present emission line diagnostics for selecting candidate IMBHs in metal-poor, star-forming galaxies based on state-of-the-art photoionization simulations that include ionizing contributions from IMBHs, XRBs, and massive stars that vary with time and metallicity. These simulations suggest that while XRBs can contaminate line searches for IMBHs in low-metallicity star-forming galaxies, select emission line diagnostics, such as those detectable with JWST, can effectively distinguish between IMBH or XRB induced photoionization. We apply these emission line diagnostics to a sample of galaxies from SDSS for which there are archival Chandra data, and report the X-ray properties of this new candidate IMBH sample. Finally, we discuss these results in the context of prospects for IMBH searches locally and at high redshift with JWST.",

Thus, they represent ideal local laboratories for detailed multiwavelength studies of their properties and mechanisms that shape them. We report the first JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the BCD SBS 0335-052 E, analyzing MIR emission lines tracing different levels of ionization (e.g., [Ne II], [S IV], [Ne III], [O IV], [Ne V]) of the ionized gas. SBS 0335-052 E MIR emission is characterized by a bright point source, located in one of the youngest and most embedded stellar clusters (t \u223c 3 Myr, A<SUB>V</SUB> \u223c 15), and underlying extended high-ionization emission (i.e., [O IV] and [Ne V]) from the surroundings of the older and less dusty stellar clusters (t &lt; 20 Myr, A<SUB>V</SUB> \u223c 8). From a comparison with state-of-the-art models, we can exclude shocks, X-ray binaries, and old stellar populations as the main sources of ionization. Interestingly, a 4%\u20138% contribution of a \u223c10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) is needed to justify the strong [Ne V]/[Ne II] and would be consistent with optical/UV line ratios from previous studies.

Also, star-forming models (regardless of including X-ray binaries) struggle to reproduce even the lower ionization line ratios (e.g., [S IV]/[Ne II]) typically observed in BCDs. Overall, while current models suggest the need to account for an accreting IMBH in this high-z analog, limitations still exist in predicting high-ionization emission lines (I.P. &gt; 54 eV) when modeling these low-metallicity environments, and thus other sources of ionization cannot be fully ruled out.",
