        "1": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "Directly confronts theoretical predictions with observations of the BPT diagram's evolution, introduces a redshift-dependent classification line, and aligns with the main paper's focus on modeling optical line ratio evolution. Both address AGN/star-forming separation challenges at high-z."
        },
        "2": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "Relevant for discussing BPT diagram limitations and selection effects at high-z, but focuses on empirical luminosity evolution rather than theoretical ISM/radiation field modeling. Less aligned with the main paper's hydrodynamic simulation approach."
        },
        "3": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "Provides observational data on high-z galaxy line ratios and metallicity, relevant to the main paper's themes, but lacks theoretical modeling of line ratio evolution. Focuses on local analogs (e.g., M82) rather than cosmological predictions."
        },
        "4": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "Highly relevant: Uses JWST grism data to test [O III]/Hβ vs. [Ne III]/[O II] diagrams, directly comparing with MAPPINGS photoionization models. Aligns with the main paper's goal of predicting line ratio evolution for future surveys."
        },
        "5": {
            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "Focuses on low-z dwarf AGN diagnostics optimization, with limited relevance to the main paper's cosmic time evolution focus. Shared interest in metallicity-sensitive line ratios but different redshift regimes."
        },
        "6": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "Examines metallicity indicators' redshift evolution and cautions against local BPT calibrations at high-z, which complements the main paper's discussion. However, focuses on MZR/FMR rather than theoretical line ratio predictions."
        },
        "7": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "Highly relevant: Uses JWST/NIRCam WFSS to study line ratios up to z~9, compares with MAPPINGS/IllustrisTNG models, and discusses ionization trends. Directly supports the main paper's modeling context for JWST-era surveys."
        },
        "8": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "Critical relevance: Observes BPT diagram offsets at z~2.3, attributes them to N/O abundance ratios, and validates O32+R23 as metallicity indicators. Matches the main paper's focus on metallicity-driven line ratio evolution."
        },
        "9": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "Directly addresses BPT diagram offsets at z~1.6, links to ionization parameter/metallicity evolution, and uses photoionization models. Aligns with the main paper's ISM condition analysis across cosmic time."
        },
        "10": {
            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "Proposes novel AGN diagnostics using [O III]λ4363, methodologically distinct from the main paper's BPT focus. Limited overlap beyond general AGN classification challenges."
        }
    },
    "overall_analysis": {
        "strengths": [
            "Multiple results (1,4,7-9) provide direct observational/theoretical comparisons of BPT diagram evolution and metallicity effects, closely aligning with the main paper's goals.",
            "Several studies (4,7,8) use JWST or HST data to validate models, supporting the main paper's context for future near-infrared surveys.",
            "Consistent focus on ionization parameters and metallicity gradients across redshifts strengthens the main paper's narrative."
        ],
        "weaknesses": [
            "Results 5 and 10 focus on niche diagnostics (low-z dwarfs/auroral lines) with limited relevance to the main paper's broad cosmic timeline.",
            "Some papers (2,3,6) emphasize empirical relations over theoretical predictions, reducing methodological alignment."
        ],
        "suggestions": [
            "Prioritize studies combining hydrodynamic simulations with multi-epoch JWST/NIRSpec data to strengthen theoretical evolution claims.",
            "Include more comparisons to shock ionization models (mentioned in the main paper) in future literature reviews.",
            "Expand discussion on nitrogen abundance evolution (as in Result 8) to contextualize BPT diagram offsets."
