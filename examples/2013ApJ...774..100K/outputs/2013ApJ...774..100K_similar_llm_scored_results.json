  "abstract": "We use the chemical evolution predictions of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with our latest theoretical stellar population synthesis, photoionization, and shock models to predict the strong line evolution of ensembles of galaxies from z = 3 to the present day. In this paper, we focus on the brightest optical emission-line ratios, [N II]/H\u03b1 and [O III]/H\u03b2. We use the optical diagnostic Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram as a tool for investigating the spectral properties of ensembles of active galaxies. We use four redshift windows chosen to exploit new near-infrared multi-object spectrographs. We predict how the BPT diagram will appear in these four redshift windows given different sets of assumptions. We show that the position of star-forming galaxies on the BPT diagram traces the interstellar medium conditions and radiation field in galaxies at a given redshift. Galaxies containing active galactic nucleus (AGN) form a mixing sequence with purely star-forming galaxies. This mixing sequence may change dramatically with cosmic time, due to the metallicity sensitivity of the optical emission-lines. Furthermore, the position of the mixing sequence may probe metallicity gradients in galaxies as a function of redshift, depending on the size of the AGN narrow-line region. We apply our latest slow shock models for gas shocked by galactic-scale winds. We show that at high redshift, galactic wind shocks are clearly separated from AGN in line ratio space. Instead, shocks from galactic winds mimic high metallicity starburst galaxies. We discuss our models in the context of future large near-infrared spectroscopic surveys.",

      "title": "The Cosmic BPT Diagram: Confronting Theory with Observations",
      "abstract": "We compare a large sample of galaxies between 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.6 with theoretical predictions for how the optical diagnostic line ratios in galaxy ensembles change as a function of cosmic time. We show that star-forming galaxies at high redshift (z &gt; 1.5) are consistent with a model in which the interstellar medium conditions are more extreme at high redshift than seen in the global spectra of local galaxies. We speculate that global spectra of our high-redshift galaxies may be dominated by H II regions similar to the extreme clumpy, dense star-forming complexes in the Antennae and M82. The transition to local-type conditions occurs between 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. We conclude that classification schemes developed for local samples should not be applied at high redshift (z &gt;= 1.5). We use our theoretical models to derive a new redshift-dependent classification line that utilizes the standard optical diagnostic line ratios [O III]/H\u03b2 and [N II]/H\u03b1. Our new line can be used to separate star-forming galaxies from active galactic nuclei (AGN) between z = 0 to z ~ 3.5. We anticipate that our redshift-dependent optical classification line will be useful for future large surveys with near-infrared multi-object spectrographs. We apply our classification line to a sample of gravitationally lensed galaxies at z ~ 2.5. Although limited by small numbers, we show that our classification line is consistent with the position of AGN that have been independently confirmed via other methods.",

      "abstract": "Emission line diagnostic diagrams probing the ionization sources in galaxies, such as the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram, have been used extensively to distinguish active galactic nuclei (AGN) from purely star-forming galaxies. However, they remain poorly understood at higher redshifts. We shed light on this issue with an empirical approach based on a z ~ 0 reference sample built from ~300,000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies, from which we mimic selection effects due to typical emission line detection limits at higher redshift. We combine this low-redshift reference sample with a simple prescription for luminosity evolution of the global galaxy population to predict the loci of high-redshift galaxies on the BPT and Mass-Excitation (MEx) diagnostic diagrams. The predicted bivariate distributions agree remarkably well with direct observations of galaxies out to z ~ 1.5, including the observed stellar mass-metallicity (MZ) relation evolution. As a result, we infer that high-redshift star-forming galaxies are consistent with having normal interstellar medium (ISM) properties out to z ~ 1.5, after accounting for selection effects and line luminosity evolution. Namely, their optical line ratios and gas-phase metallicities are comparable to that of low-redshift galaxies with equivalent emission-line luminosities. In contrast, AGN narrow-line regions may show a shift toward lower metallicities at higher redshift. While a physical evolution of the ISM conditions is not ruled out for purely star-forming galaxies and may be more important starting at z &gt;~ 2, we find that reliably quantifying this evolution is hindered by selections effects. The recipes provided here may serve as a basis for future studies toward this goal. Code to predict the loci of galaxies on the BPT and MEx diagnostic diagrams and the MZ relation as a function of emission line luminosity limits is made publicly available.",

The sample was selected from the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallels survey, which uses the near-infrared grism of the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) to detect emission-line galaxies over 0.3 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 2.3. Our FIRE follow-up spectroscopy (R ~ 5000) over 1.0-2.5 \u03bcm permits detailed measurements of the physical properties of the z ~ 2 emission-line galaxies. Dust-corrected star formation rates for the sample range from ~5-100 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> with a mean of 29 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. We derive a median metallicity for the sample of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.34 or ~0.45 Z <SUB>\u2299</SUB>. The estimated stellar masses range from ~10<SUP>8.5</SUP>-10<SUP>9.5</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>, and a clear positive correlation between metallicity and stellar mass is observed. The average ionization parameter measured for the sample, log U \u2248 -2.5, is significantly higher than what is found for most star-forming galaxies in the local universe, but similar to the values found for other star-forming galaxies at high redshift. We derive composite spectra from the FIRE sample, from which we measure typical nebular electron densities of ~100-400 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Based on the location of the galaxies and composite spectra on diagnostic diagrams, we do not find evidence for significant active galactic nucleus activity in the sample. Most of the galaxies, as well as the composites, are offset diagram toward higher [O III]/H\u03b2 at a given [N II]/H\u03b1, in agreement with other observations of z &gt;~ 1 star-forming galaxies, but composite spectra derived from the sample do not show an appreciable offset from the local star-forming sequence on the [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [S II]/H\u03b1 diagram. We infer a high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio from the composite spectrum, which may contribute to the offset of the high-redshift galaxies from the local star-forming sequence in the [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [N II]/H\u03b1 diagram.

      "abstract": "Existing star-forming vs. active galactic nucleus (AGN) classification schemes using optical emission-line diagnostics mostly fail for low-metallicity and/or highly star-forming galaxies, missing AGN in typical z ~ 0 dwarfs. To recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey emission-line catalogs overlapping the volume- and mass-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntex (ECO) surveys to determine the AGN percentage in SEL dwarfs. Our photoionization grids show that the [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [S II]/H\u03b1 diagram (S II plot) and [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [O I]/H\u03b1 diagram (O I plot) are less metallicity sensitive and more successful in identifying dwarf AGN than the popular [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [N II]/H\u03b1 diagnostic (N II plot or \"BPT diagram\"). We identify a new category of \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN) classified as star-forming by the N II plot but as AGN by the S II and/or O I plots. Including SF-AGN, we find the z ~ 0 AGN percentage in dwarfs with SELs to be ~3%-16%, far exceeding most previous optical estimates (~1%). The large range in our dwarf AGN percentage reflects differences in spectral fitting methodologies between catalogs. The highly complete nature of RESOLVE and ECO allows us to normalize strong emission-line galaxy statistics to the full galaxy population, reducing the dwarf AGN percentage to ~0.6%-3.0%. The newly identified SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs with halo mass &lt;10<SUP>11.5</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>, where highly efficient cosmic gas accretion is expected.

We derive a mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for our sample with metallicities based on the oxygen and H\u03b2 nebular emission lines. We find the MZR derived from our data to have the same trend as previous determinations in the range 0 &lt; z &lt; 3 with metallicity decreasing with stellar mass. However, we find that our MZR is offset from a previous determination at z \u2273 2 which used metallicities derived from the [N II]/H\u03b1 ratio. Incorporating star formation rate information, we find that our galaxies are also offset from the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) by \u223c0.3 dex. Using the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram we argue that, if the physical conditions of star-forming regions evolve with redshift, metallicity indicators based on [N II] and H\u03b1, calibrated in the local Universe, may not be consistent with the ones based on oxygen lines and H\u03b2. Our results thus suggest that the evolution of the FMR previously reported at z \u223c 2-3 may be an artefact of the differential evolution in metallicity indicators and caution against using locally calibrated empirical metallicity relations at high redshift, which do not account for evolution in the physical conditions of star-forming regions.",

Finally, we demonstrate that the stellar masses, metallicities, and star formation rates of the FMOS sample are well fit with a physically motivated model for the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies.",

      "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of black hole formation and growth in the early Universe. However, JWST has also revealed that some of the classical diagnostics, such as the Baldwin, Phillips &amp; Terlevich (BPT) diagrams and X-ray emission, often fail to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift and low metallicity. Here we present three new rest-frame optical diagnostic diagrams to identify narrow-line Type II AGN, leveraging the [OIII]\u03bb4363 auroral line, which has been detected in several JWST spectra. Specifically, we show that high values of the [OIII]\u03bb 4363 / H\u03b3 ratio provide a sufficient (but not necessary) condition to identify the presence of an AGN, based on empirical calibrations (using local and high-redshift sources) and on a broad range of photoionization models. These diagnostics are able to separate much of the AGN population from star-forming galaxies (SFGs): the average energy of an AGN's ionizing photons is higher than that of young stars in SFGs, and hence AGN can more efficiently heat the gas, thus boosting the [OIII]\u03bb4363 line. We also found independent indications of AGN activity in some high-redshift sources (z &gt; 4) that were not previously identified as AGN with the traditional diagnostics diagrams, but that are placed in the AGN region of the diagnostic presented in this work. We note, conversely, that low values of [OIII]\u03bb 4363 / H\u03b3 can be associated either with SFGs or AGN excitation. We note that the fact that strong auroral lines are often associated with AGN does not imply that they cannot be used for direct metallicity measurements (provided that proper ionization corrections are applied), but it does affect the calibration of strong line metallicity diagnostics.",
