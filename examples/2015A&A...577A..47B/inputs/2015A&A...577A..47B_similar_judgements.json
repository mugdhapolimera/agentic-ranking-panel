  "abstract": "Context. Stars are born together from giant molecular clouds and, if we assume that the priors were chemically homogeneous and well-mixed, we expect them to share the same chemical composition. Most of the stellar aggregates are disrupted while orbiting the Galaxy and most of the dynamic information is lost, thus the only possibility of reconstructing the stellar formation history is to analyze the chemical abundances that we observe today. <BR /> Aims: The chemical tagging technique aims to recover disrupted stellar clusters based merely on their chemical composition. We evaluate the viability of this technique to recover co-natal stars that are no longer gravitationally bound. <BR /> Methods: Open clusters are co-natal aggregates that have managed to survive together. We compiled stellar spectra from 31 old and intermediate-age open clusters, homogeneously derived atmospheric parameters, and 17 abundance species, and applied machine learning algorithms to group the stars based on their chemical composition. This approach allows us to evaluate the viability and efficiency of the chemical tagging technique. <BR /> Results: We found that stars at different evolutionary stages have distinct chemical patterns that may be due to NLTE effects, atomic diffusion, mixing, and biases. When separating stars into dwarfs and giants, we observed that a few open clusters show distinct chemical signatures while the majority show a high degree of overlap. This limits the recovery of co-natal aggregates by applying the chemical tagging technique. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement if more elements are included and models are improved. <P />Based on observations obtained at the Telescope Bernard Lyot (USR5026) operated by the Observatoire Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse (Paul Sabatier), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and on public data obtained from the ESO Science Archive Facility under requests number 81252 and 81618.",

      "abstract": "Context. The evolution of massive stars is still partly unconstrained. Mass, metallicity, mass loss, and rotation are the main drivers of stellar evolution. Binarity and the magnetic field may also significantly affect the fate of massive stars. <BR /> Aims: Our goal is to investigate the evolution of single O stars in the Galaxy. <BR /> Methods: For that, we used a sample of 74 objects comprising all luminosity classes and spectral types from O4 to O9.7. We relied on optical spectroscopy obtained in the context of the MiMeS survey of massive stars. We performed spectral modelling with the code CMFGEN. We determined the surface properties of the sample stars, with special emphasis on abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. <BR /> Results: Most of our sample stars have initial masses in the range of 20 to 50 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. We show that nitrogen is more enriched and carbon and oxygen are more depleted in supergiants than in dwarfs, with giants showing intermediate degrees of mixing. CNO abundances are observed in the range of values predicted by nucleosynthesis through the CNO cycle. More massive stars, within a given luminosity class, appear to be more chemically enriched than lower mass stars. We compare our results with predictions of three types of evolutionary models and show that for two sets of models, 80% of our sample can be explained by stellar evolution including rotation. The effect of magnetism on surface abundances is unconstrained. <BR /> Conclusions: Our study indicates that in the 20-50 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> mass range, the surface chemical abundances of most single O stars in the Galaxy are fairly well accounted for by stellar evolution of rotating stars. <P />Based on observations obtained at 1) the Telescope Bernard Lyot (USR5026) operated by the Observatoire Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse (Paul Sabatier), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France; 2) at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii; 3) at the ESO/La Silla Observatory under program ID 187.D-0917.",

      "abstract": "Context. Weak G-band (wGb) stars are a very peculiar class of red giants; they are almost devoided of carbon and often present mild lithium enrichment. Despite their very puzzling abundance patterns, very few detailed spectroscopic studies existed up to a few years ago, which prevented any clear understanding of the wGb phenomenon. We recently proposed the first consistent analysis of published data for a sample of 28 wGb stars and were able to identify them as descendants of early A-type to late B-type stars, although we were not able to conclude on their evolutionary status or the origin of their peculiar abundance pattern. <BR /> Aims: Using new high-resolution spectra, we present the study of a new sample of wGb stars with the aim of homogeneously deriving their fundamental parameters and surface abundances for a selected set of chemical species that we use to improve our insight on this peculiar class of objects. <BR /> Methods: We obtained high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra for 19 wGb stars in the southern and northern hemisphere that we used to perform consistent spectral synthesis to derive their fundamental parameters and metallicities, as well as the spectroscopic abundances for Li, C, <SUP>12</SUP>C/<SUP>13</SUP>C, N, O, Na, Sr, and Ba. We also computed dedicated stellar evolution models that we used to determine the masses and to investigate the evolutionary status and chemical history of the stars in our sample. <BR /> Results: We confirm that the wGb stars are stars with initial masses in the range 3.2 to 4.2 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. We suggest that a large fraction could be mildly evolved stars on the subgiant branch currently undergoing the first dredge-up, while a smaller number of stars are more probably in the core He burning phase at the clump. After analysing their abundance pattern, we confirm their strong nitrogen enrichment anti-correlated with large carbon depletion, characteristic of material fully processed through the CNO cycle to an extent not known in evolved intermediate-mass stars in the field and in open clusters. However, we demonstrate here that such a pattern is very unlikely owing to self-enrichment. <BR /> Conclusions: In the light of the current observational constraints, no solid self-consistent pollution scenario can be presented either, leaving the wGb puzzle largely unsolved. <P />Based on data collected at La Silla Observatory (ESO, Chile), program identifier ID 089.D-0189(A), and at the Telescope Bernard Lyot (USR5026) operated by the Observatoire Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse (Paul Sabatier), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France.",

Some colliding-wind massive binaries, called particle-accelerating colliding-wind binaries (PACWB), exhibit synchrotron radio emission, which is assumed to be generated by a stellar magnetic field. However, no measurement of magnetic fields in these stars has ever been performed. <BR /> Aims: We aim at quantifying the possible stellar magnetic fields present in PACWB to provide constraints for models. <BR /> Methods: We gathered 21 high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of 9 PACWB available in the ESPaDOnS, Narval and HarpsPol archives.

While the data are not very constraining for some stars, for several stars we could derive an upper limit of the polar field strength of the order of 200 G. <BR /> Conclusions: We can therefore exclude the presence of strong or moderate stellar magnetic fields in PACWB, typical of the ones present in magnetic massive stars.

It shows a prominent rotational modulation of the spectral energy distribution and absorption line profiles due to chemical spots and exhibits a unique, strongly beamed variable radio emission. <BR /> Aims: Little is known about the magnetic field topology of CU Vir. In this study, we aim to derive detailed maps of the magnetic field distribution over the surface of this star for the first time. <BR /> Methods: We use high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations covering the entire rotational period. These data are interpreted using a multi-line technique of least-squares deconvolution (LSD) and a new Zeeman Doppler imaging code, which is based on detailed polarised radiative transfer modelling of the Stokes I and V LSD profiles. This new magnetic inversion approach relies on the spectrum synthesis calculations over the full wavelength range that is covered by observations and does not assume that the LSD profiles behave as a single spectral line with mean parameters. <BR /> Results: We present magnetic and chemical abundance maps derived from the Si and Fe lines. Mean polarisation profiles of both elements reveal a significant departure of CU Vir's magnetic field topology from the commonly assumed axisymmetric dipolar configuration. The field of CU Vir is dipolar-like but clearly non-axisymmetric, showing a large difference in the field strength between the regions of opposite polarity. The main relative abundance depletion features in both Si and Fe maps coincide with the weak-field region in the magnetic map. <BR /> Conclusions: The detailed information on the distorted dipolar magnetic field topology of CU Vir provided by our study is essential for understanding chemical spot formation, radio emission, and rotational period variation of this star. <P />Based on observations obtained at the Bernard Lyot Telescope (USR5026) operated by the Observatoire Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse (Paul Sabatier), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France.",

For metal-poor red giants, NLTE effects on Y II lines are substantial, potentially exceeding +0.5 dex.

NLTE has a differential effect on Y abundance diagnostics in late-type stars. They notably affect Y II lines in red giants and very metal-poor stars, which are typical Galactic enrichment tracers of neutron-capture elements. For main-sequence stars, NLTE effects on optical diagnostic Y II lines remain minimal across metallicities. This affirms the [Y/Mg] ratio's reliability as a cosmochronometer for Sun-like stars.",

      "abstract": "Context. So far, surface magnetic fields have never been detected on Mira stars. Only recently have the spectropolarimetric capabilities of measuring it via the Zeeman effect become available to us. Then, to complete the knowledge of the magnetic field and of its influence during the transition from asymptotic giant branch to planetary nebulae stages, we have undertaken a search for magnetic fields on the surface of Mira stars. <BR /> Aims: Our main goal is to constrain - at this stage of stellar evolution - the surface magnetic field (presence and strength) and to define the magnetic field strength dependence along the radial distance to the star, above the photosphere and across the circumstellar envelope of cool and evolved stars. <BR /> Methods: We used spectropolarimetric observations (Stokes V spectra probing circular polarization), collected with the Narval instrument at TBL, in order to detect - with the least squares deconvolution (LSD) method - a Zeeman signature in the visible part of the spectrum. <BR /> Results: We present the first spectropolarimetric observations of the S-type Mira star \u03c7 Cyg, performed around its maximum light. We detected a polarimetric signal in the Stokes V spectra and established its Zeeman origin. We claim that it is likely to be related to a weak magnetic field present at the photospheric level and in the lower part of the stellar atmosphere. We estimated the strength of its longitudinal component to about 2-3 gauss. This result favors a 1/r law for the variation in the magnetic field strength across the circumstellar envelope of \u03c7 Cyg. This is the first detection of a weak magnetic field on the stellar surface of a Mira star, and we discuss its origin in the framework of shock waves periodically propagating throughout the atmosphere of these radially pulsating stars. <BR /> Conclusions: At the date of our observations of \u03c7 Cyg, the shock wave reaches its maximum intensity, and it is likely that the shock amplifies a weak stellar magnetic field during its passage through the atmosphere. Without such an amplification by the shock, the magnetic field strength would have been too low to be detected. For the first time, we also report strong Stokes Q and U signatures (linear polarization) centered on the zero velocity (i.e., on the shock front position). They seem to indicate that the radial direction would be favored by the shock during its propagation throughout the atmosphere. <P />Based on observations obtained at the T\u00e9lescope Bernard Lyot (TBL, USR5026) at the Observatoire du Pic du Midi, operated by the Observatoire Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse (Paul Sabatier), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France.",

      "abstract": "Context. Well studied open clusters (OCs) of the solar neighborhood are frequently used as reference objects to test galactic and stellar theories. For that purpose, their chemical composition needs to be known with a high level of confidence. It is also important to clarify if each OC is chemically homogeneous and if it has a unique chemical signature. <BR /> Aims: The aims of this work are (1) to determine accurate and precise abundances of 22 chemical species (from Na to Eu) in the Hyades, Praesepe, and Rupecht 147 by using a large number of stars at different evolutionary states, (2) to evaluate the level of chemical homogeneity of these OCs, and (3) to compare their chemical signatures. <BR /> Methods: We gathered \u223c800 high resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra of \u223c100 members in the three clusters, which were obtained with the latest memberships based on Gaia DR2 data. We built a pipeline, which computes atmospheric parameters and strictly line-by-line differential abundances among twin stars in our sample. With this method, we were able to reach a very high precision in the abundances (0.01-0.02 dex in most of the elements). <BR /> Results: We find large differences in the absolute abundances in some elements, which can be attributed to diffusion, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) effects, or systematics in the analysis. For the three OCs, we find strong correlations in the differential abundances between different pairs of elements. According to our experiment with synthetic data, this can be explained by some level of chemical inhomogeneity. We compare differential abundances of several stars from the Hyades and Praesepe tails: The stars that differ more in chemical abundances also have distinct kinematics, even though they have been identified as members of the tail. <BR /> Conclusions: It is possible to obtain high precision abundances using a differential analysis even when mixing spectra from different instruments. With this technique, we find that the Hyades and Preasepe have the same chemical signature when G dwarfs and K giants are considered. Despite a certain level of inhomogeneity in each cluster, it is still possible to clearly distinguish the chemical signature of the older cluster Ruprecht 147 when compared to the Hyades and Praesepe. <P />Full Tables 2, A.1-A.3 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/635/A8\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/635/A8</A> <P />Thanks to observations at Telescope Bernard Lyot and data retrieved from the archives: ESO, TNG, FIES, ELODIE, ESPaDOnS and NARVAL.",

Moreover, its fragility makes it useful as a proxy for stellar environmental conditions. As such, the lithium abundance in old systems is at the core of various astrophysical investigations. <BR /> Aims: Stars on the lower red giant branch are key to studies of globular clusters where main sequence stars are too faint to be observed. We use these stars to analyze the initial Li content of the clusters and compare it to cosmological predictions, to measure spreads in Li between different stellar populations, and to study signs of extra depletion in these giants. <BR /> Methods: We used the GIRAFFE spectra to measure the lithium and sodium abundances of lower red giant branch stars in five globular clusters. These cover an extensive range in metallicity, from [Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.7 to [Fe/H] \u223c \u22122.3 dex. <BR /> Results: We find that the lithium abundance in these lower red giant branch stars forms a plateau, with values from A(Li)<SUB>NLTE</SUB> = 0.84 to 1.03 dex, showing no clear correlation with metallicity. When using stellar evolutionary models to calculate the primordial abundance of these clusters, we recover values of A(Li)<SUB>NLTE</SUB> = 2.1 \u2212 2.3 dex, consistent with the constant value observed in warm metal-poor halo stars, namely the Spite plateau. Additionally, we find no difference in the lithium abundance of first and second population stars in each cluster. We also report the discovery of a Li-rich giant in the cluster NGC 3201, with A(Li)<SUB>NLTE</SUB> = 1.63 \u00b1 0.18 dex, where the enrichment mechanism is probably pollution from external sources. <P />Full Table A.1 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/\">cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/657/A33\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/657/A33</A> <P />Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under ESO programme 095.D-0735(A).",

We aim at developing a fast and reliable tool for the post-processing of spectra produced by ESPaDOnS and Narval spectropolarimeters. Our inversion tool relies on principal component analysis. It allows reducing dimensionality and defining a specific metric for the search of nearest neighbours between an observed spectrum and a set of observed spectra taken from the Elodie stellar library. Effective temperature, surface gravity, total metallicity, and projected rotational velocity are derived.

For this purpose, we analyze high resolution spectra obtained by the NARVAL spectrograph for a sample composed of bright planet host stars in the northern hemisphere. The new parameters are included in the SWEET-Cat online catalogue. <BR /> Methods: To ensure that the catalogue is homogeneous, we use our standard spectroscopic analysis procedure, ARES+MOOG, to derive effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities. These spectroscopic stellar parameters are then used as input to compute the stellar mass and radius, which are fundamental for the derivation of the planetary mass and radius. <BR /> Results: We show that the spectroscopic parameters, masses, and radii are generally in good agreement with the values available in online databases of exoplanets. There are some exceptions, especially for the evolved stars. These are analyzed in detail focusing on the effect of the stellar mass on the derived planetary mass. <BR /> Conclusions: We conclude that the stellar mass estimations for giant stars should be managed with extreme caution when using them to compute the planetary masses.

      "abstract": "Context. Atomic diffusion and mixing processes in stellar interiors influence the structure and the surface composition of stars. Some of these processes cannot yet be modelled from the first principles, and they require calibrations. This limits their applicability in stellar models used for studies of stellar populations and Galactic evolution. <BR /> Aims: Our main goal is to put constraints on the stellar structure and evolution models using new refined measurements of the chemical composition in stars of a Galactic open cluster. <BR /> Methods: We used medium-resolution, 19 200 \u2264 R \u2264 21 500, optical spectra of stars in the open cluster <ASTROBJ>NGC 2420</ASTROBJ> obtained within the Gaia-ESO survey. The sample covers all evolutionary stages from the main sequence to the red giant branch. Stellar parameters were derived using a combined Bayesian analysis of spectra, 2MASS photometry, and astrometric data from Gaia DR2. The abundances of Mg, Ca, Fe, and Li were determined from non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) synthetic spectra, which were computed using one-dimensional (1D) and averaged three-dimensional (3D) model atmospheres. We compare our results with a grid of Code d'Evolution Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire (CESTAM) stellar evolution models, which include atomic diffusion, turbulent, and rotational mixing. <BR /> Results: We find prominent evolutionary trends in the abundances of Fe, Ca, Mg, and Li with the mass of the stars in the cluster. Furthermore, Fe, Mg, and Ca show a depletion at the cluster turn-off, but the abundances gradually increase and flatten near the base of the red giant branch. The abundance trend for Li displays a signature of rotational mixing on the main sequence and abrupt depletion on the sub-giant branch, which is caused by advection of Li-poor material to the surface. The analysis of abundances combined with the CESTAM model predictions allows us to place limits on the parameter space of the models and to constrain the zone in the stellar interior, where turbulent mixing takes place. <P />Based on observations collected with the ESO Very Large Telescope at the La Silla Paranal Observatory in Chile for the Gaia-ESO Public Survey (program IDs 188.B-3002 and 193.B-0936).",

Based on the high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the Subaru Telescope for 103 VMP stars, in this series of papers we homogeneously investigate the nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundances of important astrophysical elements. This sample covers a wide metallicity range from [Fe/H] \u223c \u20111.7 dex down to \u20114.3 dex, including 13 objects with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u20113.0 dex. Here, we present a set of homogeneous stellar atmospheric parameters, including the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and microturbulence velocity with the spectroscopic method, and the NLTE line formation for both Fe I and Fe II in the classical one-dimensional model atmospheres have been considered. The NLTE effects of the Fe I lines range from \u223c0.03 dex to \u223c0.3 dex, and increase with decreasing metallicity. In addition, they depend on the surface gravity, which generally increases with decreasing <inline-formula> </inline-formula>. The largest NLTE effects can be found for the giants of <inline-formula> </inline-formula> \u223c 2.5 dex.

The rapidly rotating \u03b4 Scuti star \u03b2 Cas can be considered as a benchmark star to study the interaction of several of these effects. <BR /> Aims: We investigate the pulsational and magnetic field properties of \u03b2 Cas. We also determine the star's apparent fundamental parameters and chemical abundances. <BR /> Methods: Based on photometric time series obtained from three different space missions (BRITE-Constellation, SMEI, and TESS), we conduct a frequency analysis and investigate the stability of the pulsation amplitudes over four years of observations. We investigate the presence of a magnetic field and its properties using spectropolarimetric observations taken with the Narval instrument by applying the least-squares deconvolution and Zeeman-Doppler imaging techniques. <BR /> Results: The star \u03b2 Cas shows only three independent p-mode frequencies down to the few ppm-level; its highest amplitude frequency is suggested to be an n = 3, \u2113 = 2, m = 0 mode. Its magnetic field structure is quite complex and almost certainly of a dynamo origin. The atmosphere of \u03b2 Cas is slightly deficient in iron peak elements and slightly overabundant in C, O, and heavier elements. <BR /> Conclusions: Atypically for \u03b4 Scuti stars, we can only detect three pulsation modes down to exceptionally low noise levels for \u03b2 Cas. The star is also one of very few \u03b4 Scuti pulsators known to date to show a measurable magnetic field and the first \u03b4 Scuti star with a dynamo magnetic field. These characteristics make \u03b2 Cas an interesting target for future studies of dynamo processes in the thin convective envelopes of F-type stars, the transition region between fossil and dynamo fields, and the interaction between pulsations and magnetic field. <P />The BRITE data are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/643/A110\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/643/A110</A> <P />Based on data collected by the BRITE Constellation satellite mission, designed, built, launched, operated and supported by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), the University of Vienna, the Technical University of Graz, the University of Innsbruck, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS), the Foundation for Polish Science &amp; Technology (FNiTP MNiSW), and National Science Centre (NCN).
