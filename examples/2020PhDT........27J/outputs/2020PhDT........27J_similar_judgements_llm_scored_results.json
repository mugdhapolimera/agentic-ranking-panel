  "abstract": "During the first stages of planet formation small particles (~0.1 \u2013 1 \u00b5m) in the protoplanetary disk collide at low relative velocities (less than 1 m/s) and tend to aggregate into cm-size \"pebbles\" through a combination of electrostatic interactions and gravitational streaming instabilities. Particles in this size regime also compose a layer of regolith on small, airless bodies that evolves under conditions very different than those on Earth. Characterizing the response of regolith to low-energy impacts in a microgravity environment is therefore critical to our understanding of the processes that lead to the formation of these objects and our ability to develop safe operation procedures on their surfaces. Flight-based microgravity experiments investigating low-velocity collisions of cm-size projectiles into regolith have revealed that certain impact events result in mass transfer from the target regolith onto the surface of the projectile. Characterizing the key parameters and their interactions that produce these events have important implications for the role of energy dissipation and accretion in planet formation processes and understanding the mechanical behavior of granular media composing the surfaces of small bodies. I carried out experimental and numerical campaigns designed to investigate these mass transfer events and found that accretion outcomes differ significantly depending on whether the projectile is launched into granular material or initially at rest before pulling away from the granular bed. I found that interaction effects between various parameters and the balance of the experiment design significantly influence mass transfer outcomes and must be taken into account for future experiment designs. I also present my contributions to a CubeSat mission that will provide the opportunity to observe tens of thousands of collisions between particles in the velocity and size regime relevant to the earliest stages of planet formation.",

Flight-based microgravity experiments investigating low-velocity collisions of cm-size projectiles into regolith have revealed that certain impact events result in a mass transfer from the target regolith onto the surface of the projectile. The key parameters that produce these events need to be characterized to understand the mechanical behavior of granular media, which is composed of the surfaces of small bodies. We carried out flight and ground-based research campaigns designed to investigate these mass transfer events. The goals of our experimental campaigns were (1) to identify projectile energy thresholds that influence mass transfer outcomes in low-energy collision events between cm-size projectiles and \u03bcm-size regolith, (2) to determine whether these mass transfer events required a microgravity environment to be observed, and (3) to determine whether the rebound portion of these collision events could be replicated in a laboratory drop tower environment. We found that (1) mass transfer events occurred for projectile rebound accelerations &lt;7.8 m/s2 and we were unable to identify a corresponding impact velocity threshold, (2) mass transfer events require a microgravity environment, and (3) ourdrop tower experiments were able to produce mass transfer events. However, drop tower experiments do not exactly reproduce the free-particle impacts and rebound of the long-duration microgravity experiments and yielded systematically lower amounts of the overall mass transferred.",

Additionally, exploration and sample return missions to asteroids and other small, airless bodies involve low energy interactions with weakly-bound regolith particles. Therefore, to characterize the processes that lead to planetesimal formation and planetary ring collisional evolution, and to develop appropriate procedures for asteroid sample return missions, it is necessary to understand how regolith responds to low-energy collisions in a microgravity environment. The COLLIDE (Collisions Into Dust Experiment) and PRIME (Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment) programs produced observations of mass transfer of regolith onto cm-scale projectiles at impact velocities &lt; 40 cm/s in microgravity conditions. These experiments were carried out on orbit (COLLIDE, COLLIDE-2), in suborbital space (COLLIDE-3), and on parabolic airplane flights (PRIME) under vacuum. To study this phenomenon with significantly reduced cost and time constraints we have developed an experimental apparatus that makes use of a laboratory drop tower (free-fall time 0.75 s). The experiment consists of a tube pumped to vacuum conditions containing a cm-diameter marble suspended from a spring in contact with a bed of regolith. The spring contracts during free-fall allowing us to simulate the rebound portion of a low-velocity collision in a laboratory microgravity environment. We are also carrying out concurrent numerical simulations with the use of a discrete element method particle simulation program, LIGGGHTS (Kloss et al. 2012, Prog. Comp. Fluid Dyn., 12, 140), to replicate these environmental conditions and study the role of cohesion in mass transfer events.

The COLLIDE (Collisions Into Dust Experiment) and PRIME (Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment) programs created impacts into simulated planetary regolith with cm-scale impactors to observe ejecta production and coefficients of restitution in microgravity. These experiments were carried out on orbit (COLLIDE, COLLIDE-2), in suborbital space (COLLIDE-3), and on parabolic airplane flights (PRIME) under vacuum. Some impacts at speeds less than 40 cm/s resulted in mass transfer from the target regolith onto the impactor. To study these mass-transfer collisions in more detail without the cost or time requirements of spaceflight or parabolic flights, we developed an experimental apparatus in a laboratory drop tower (free-fall time 0.75 s) and performed experiments at standard pressure. The impactor is suspended from a spring and remains in contact with the bed of regolith until free-fall allows the spring to retract and pull the impactor upwards. This method allowed us to simulate the rebound portion of a low-velocity collision in a laboratory microgravity environment. We achieved rebound velocities of 10 - 60 cm/s, and we observed mass transfer events with rebound speeds below 40 cm/s. The amount of mass transfer produced was more significant than a monolayer of granular material, but less than the amount observed in the COLLIDE and PRIME experiments. These mass-transfer collisions may play a role in the growth of planetesimals. We will present the results of our laboratory-based studies where we vary impact velocity and target material, and discuss implications for collisional evolution in the protoplanetary disk and planetary rings.",

The long duration, high-quality microgravity environment provided by a CubeSat is the perfect platform to study the collisional evolution of particles in the size regime relevant to the first stages of planet formation. Q-PACE is a 3U CubeSat mission designed to produce tens of thousands of low-velocity (mm/s - cm/s) collisions between micron to cm-size particles. The large number of collisions will make it possible to provide a probabilistic description of collisional outcomes that can be used in planet formation models. The experiment consists of particles contained within a backlit experimental test chamber (ETC) within the CubeSat, a shaking mechanism to control the particle ensemble velocity distribution, a chamber to introduce new particles at different experiment phases, and an overhead camera to record collisions within the chamber. Experiments will be carried out in four phases: (1) collisions between 5 1-cm and 30 2-mm particles in the ETC; (2) addition of 30 mm-size chondrules to the ETC; (3) addition of 100-micron SiO<SUB>2</SUB> dust aggregates to the ETC; and (4) vigorous shaking of the ETC to disaggregate the dust aggregates and observe dust-coated particle interactions. To reproduce the anticipated results of these experiments we carried out simulations using the DEM granular mechanics software LIGGGHTS. The tunable parameters of our simulation include the particle number density and size distribution selected to reflect discrete experimental phases, the particle velocity distribution, and the cohesive properties of the particles. Through our simulations we identify formation timescales for clusters of varying sizes as well as the frequency of accretion, bouncing, and fragmentation events as a function of the tunable parameters. We present the results of our numerical simulations as well as the implications for interpreting future data produced by the Q-PACE mission.",

In the current discussion on the processes involved in accretion beyond the cm scale, the size distribution of the particles colliding at low speeds (a few m/s) inside the PPD is thought to play an important role. A few larger bodies that survived bouncing and fragmentation collisions accumulate the fine dust residue of the erosion and fragmentation of other particles that were destroyed in more energetic collisions. A significant component of this dust on bodies farther out in the PPD will be composed of ices.We have carried out a series of experiments to study the ejecta mass-velocity distribution from impacts of cm-scale particles into granular media at speeds below 3 m/s in both microgravity and 1-g conditions in vacuo and room temperature. Aggregate-aggregate collision experiments have shown bouncing and fragmentation at speeds above ~ 1 m/s. However, most planetesimal formation occurred beyond the frost line and at much lower temperatures than our earlier experiments. We have performed impact experiments at 1-g into JSC-1 lunar regolith simulant at low temperatures (&lt;150 K) with water ice particles mixed into the JSC-1 sample. We varied the impact energy and the water ice content of the sample and measured the ejecta mass-velocity distribution as well as the final crater size. Our goal is to determine if the cryogenic temperature and the presence of water ice in the regolith affects the dynamic response to low-velocity impacts and the production of regolith. We will present the results of the cryogenic impacts and compare them to the study performed at room temperature without water ice. The inclusion of water ice into the target sample is a first step towards better understanding the influence of the presence of water ice in the production of ejecta in response to low-velocity impacts. We will discuss the implications of our results for planetary ring particle collisions as well as planetesimal formation.",

      "abstract": "Context. Streaming instability is a key mechanism in planet formation, clustering pebbles into planetesimals with the help of self-gravity. It is triggered at a particular disk location where the local volume density of solids exceeds that of the gas. After their formation, planetesimals can grow into protoplanets by feeding from other planetesimals in the birth ring as well as by accreting inwardly drifting pebbles from the outer disk. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the growth of planetesimals into protoplanets at a single location through streaming instability. For a solar-mass star, we test the conditions under which super-Earths are able to form within the lifetime of the gaseous disk. <BR /> Methods: We modified the Mercury N-body code to trace the growth and dynamical evolution of a swarm of planetesimals at a distance of 2.7 AU from the star. The code simulates gravitational interactions and collisions among planetesimals, gas drag, type I torque, and pebble accretion. Three distributions of planetesimal sizes were investigated: (i) a mono-dispersed population of 400 km radius planetesimals, (ii) a poly-dispersed population of planetesimals from 200 km up to 1000 km, (iii) a bimodal distribution with a single runaway body and a swarm of smaller, 100 km size planetesimals. <BR /> Results: The mono-dispersed population of 400 km size planetesimals cannot form protoplanets of a mass greater than that of the Earth. Their eccentricities and inclinations are quickly excited, which suppresses both planetesimal accretion and pebble accretion. Planets can form from the poly-dispersed and bimodal distributions. In these circumstances, it is the two-component nature that damps the random velocity of the large embryo through the dynamical friction of small planetesimals, allowing the embryo to accrete pebbles efficiently when it approaches 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M<SUB>\u2295</SUB>. Accounting for migration, close-in super-Earth planets form. Super-Earth planets are likely to form when the pebble mass flux is higher, the disk turbulence is lower, or the Stokes number of the pebbles is higher. <BR /> Conclusions: For the single site planetesimal formation scenario, a two-component mass distribution with a large embryo and small planetesimals promotes planet growth, first by planetesimal accretion and then by pebble accretion of the most massive protoplanet. Planetesimal formation at single locations such as ice lines naturally leads to super-Earth planets by the combined mechanisms of planetesimal accretion and pebble accretion.",

The planet formation process takes place in the interior of dusty disks, which offer us only limited observational constraints. Historically, the two main paradigms describing planet formation are the disk instability and core accretion models. In the former giant planets condense directly form a disk massive enough to fragments under its own self-gravity. In contrast, the core accretion model follows a bottom-up approach driven by the growth of solid bodies. The core accretion model includes the direct growth phase, where pebble and possibly planetesimal sized bodies form by surface-driven processes. Alternatively, planetesimal bodies can emerge from instabilities in the solid population, leading to the formation of clumps that ultimately collapse. The later stages of the core accretion model involve the emergence of protoplanets from the planetesimal population, which accretes smaller bodies|planetesimals or pebbles|before ultimately accreting freely the gas of the disk. In this Chapter I will review these formation mechanisms, aiming, where possible, to build an intuitive understanding from elementary physical principles.",

Although dust grains are thought to grow up to micrometer-sized particles in the dense regions of molecular clouds, the growth to pebbles and kilometer-sized bodies must occur at the high densities within protoplanetary disks. This critical step is the last stage of solids evolution that can be observed directly in extrasolar systems before the appearance of large planetary-sized bodies. In this chapter we review the constraints on the physics of grain-grain collisions as they have emerged from laboratory experiments and numerical computations. We then review the current theoretical understanding of the global processes governing the evolution of solids in protoplanetary disks, including dust settling, growth, and radial transport. The predicted observational signatures of these processes are summarized. We briefly discuss grain growth in molecular cloud cores and in collapsing envelopes of protostars, as these likely provide the initial conditions for the dust in protoplanetary disks. We then review the observational constraints on grain growth in disks from millimeter surveys, as well as the very recent evidence for radial variations of the dust properties in disks. We also include a brief discussion on the small end of the grain size distribution and dust settling as derived from optical, near-, and mid-infrared observations. Results are discussed in the context of global dust-evolution models; in particular, we focus on the emerging evidence for a very efficient early growth of grains and the radial distribution of maximum grain sizes as the result of growth barriers. We also highlight the limits of the current models of dust evolution in disks, including the need to slow the radial drift of grains to overcome the migration/fragmentation barrier.",

We conduct high-resolution simulations of collisions between planetesimals; the results are used to isolate the effects of different impact parameters on collision outcome. During growth from planetesimals to planets, collision outcomes span multiple regimes: cratering, merging, disruption, super-catastrophic disruption, and hit-and-run events. We derive equations (scaling laws) to demarcate the transition between collision regimes and to describe the size and velocity distributions of the post-collision bodies. The scaling laws are used to calculate maps of collision outcomes as a function of mass ratio, impact angle, and impact velocity, and we discuss the implications of the probability of each collision regime during planet formation. Collision outcomes are described in terms of the impact conditions and the catastrophic disruption criteria, Q*<SUB>RD</SUB>\u2014the specific energy required to disperse half the total colliding mass. All planet formation and collisional evolution studies have assumed that catastrophic disruption follows pure energy scaling; however, we find that catastrophic disruption follows nearly pure momentum scaling. As a result, Q*<SUB>RD</SUB> is strongly dependent on the impact velocity and projectile-to-target mass ratio in addition to the total mass and impact angle. To account for the impact angle, we derive the interacting mass fraction of the projectile; the outcome of a collision is dependent on the kinetic energy of the interacting mass rather than the kinetic energy of the total mass. We also introduce a new material parameter, c*, that defines the catastrophic disruption criteria between equal-mass bodies in units of the specific gravitational binding energy. For a diverse range of planetesimal compositions and internal structures, c* has a value of 5 \u00b1 2; whereas for strengthless planets, we find c* = 1.9 \u00b1 0.3. We refer to the catastrophic disruption criteria for equal-mass bodies as the principal disruption curve, which is used as the reference value in the calculation of Q*<SUB>RD</SUB> for any collision scenario.

      "abstract": "In the core accretion model for giant planet formation, a solid core forms by coagulation of dust grains in a protoplanetary disk and then accretes gas from the disk when the core reaches a critical mass. Both stages must be completed in a few million years before the disk gas disperses. The slowest stage of this process may be oligarchic growth in which a giant-planet core grows by sweeping up smaller, asteroid-size planetesimals. Here, we describe new numerical simulations of oligarchic growth using a particle-in-a-box model. The simulations include several processes that can effect oligarchic growth: (i) planetesimal fragmentation due to mutual collisions, (ii) the modified capture rate of planetesimals due to a core\u2019s atmosphere, (iii) drag with the disk gas during encounters with the core (so-called \u201cpebble accretion\u201d), (iv) modification of particle velocities by turbulence and drift caused by gas drag, (v) the presence of a population of mm-to-m size \u201cpebbles\u201d that represent the transition point between disruptive collisions between larger particles, and mergers between dust grains, and (vi) radial drift of small objects due to gas drag. Collisions between planetesimals rapidly generate a population of pebbles. The rate at which a core sweeps up pebbles is controlled by pebble accretion dynamics. Metre-size pebbles lose energy during an encounter with a core due to drag, and settle towards the core, greatly increasing the capture probability during a single encounter. Millimetre-size pebbles are tightly coupled to the gas and most are swept past the core during an encounter rather than being captured. Accretion efficiency per encounter increases with pebble size in this size range. However, radial drift rates also increase with size, so metre-size objects encounter a core on many fewer occasions than mm-size pebbles before they drift out of a region. The net result is that core growth rates vary weakly with pebble size, with the optimal diameter being about 10 cm. The main effect of planetesimal size is to determine the rate of mutual collisions, fragment production and the formation of pebbles. 1-km-diameter planetesimals collide frequently and have low impact strengths, leading to a large surface density of pebbles and rapid core growth via pebble accretion. 100-km-diameter planetesimals produce fewer pebbles, and pebble accretion plays a minor role in this case. The strength of turbulence in the gas determines the scale height of pebbles in the disk, which affects the rate at which they are accreted. For an initial solid surface density of 12 g/cm<SUP>2</SUP> at 5 AU, with 10-cm diameter pebbles and a disk viscosity parameter \u03b1=10<SUP>-4</SUP>, a 10-Earth mass core can form in 3 My for 1-10 km diameter planetesimals. The growth of such a core requires longer than 3 My if planetesimals are 100 km in diameter.",

The particles involved in these low-velocity collisions have negligible gravity and may be made of or coated with smaller dust grains and aggregates. We undertook microgravity impact experiments to better understand the dissipation of energy and production of ejecta in these collisions. Here we report the results of impact experiments of solid projectiles into beds of granular material at impact velocities from 0.2 to 2.3 m/s performed under near-weightless conditions on the NASA KC-135 Weightless Wonder V. Impactors of various densities and radii of 1 and 2 cm were launched into targets of quartz sand, JSC-1 lunar regolith simulant, and JSC-Mars-1 martian regolith simulant. Most impacts were at normal or near-normal incidence angles, though some impacts were at oblique angles. Oblique impacts led to much higher ejection velocities and ejecta masses than normal impacts. For normal incidence impacts, characteristic ejecta velocities increase with impactor kinetic energy, KE, as approximately KE<SUP>0.5</SUP>. Ejecta masses could not be measured accurately due to the nature of the experiment, but qualitatively also increased with impactor kinetic energy. Some experiments were near the threshold velocity of 0.2 m/s identified in previous microgravity impact experiments as the minimum velocity needed to produce ejecta [Colwell, J.E., 2003. Icarus 164, 188-196], and the experimental scatter is large at these low speeds in the airplane experiment. A more precise exploration of the transition from low-ejecta-mass impacts to high-ejecta-mass impacts requires a longer and smoother period of reduced gravity. Coefficient of restitution measurements are not possible due to the varying acceleration of the airplane throughout the experiment.",

The Collisions Into Dust Experiment (COLLIDE) and Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment (PRIME) experiments produced observations of mass transfer from regolith onto an impactor at these velocities in microgravity. We have subsequently carried out ground-based experiments in which a cm-scale sphere impacts and rebounds from a bed of granular material in 1-g laboratory conditions at low impact speeds with the aid of a spring. This allows impacts at v&lt;1 m/s and ensures rebound of the impactor, with the spring providing enough force to overcome gravity. Preliminary results from an impact of a brass impactor into sand (200-500 \u03bcm) produced a monolayer of granular material onto the impactor, but the grains are not cohesive enough to allow a significant mass transfer under these conditions. Further experiments with a range of regolith properties, impactor composition and surface properties, impact velocities, and atmospheric conditions will be performed in the laboratory to study the effects of each of these properties on the contact transfer of regolith onto the impactor. Further microgravity experiments with PRIME and in a small drop tower are planned to then study bulk mass transfer with conditions informed by the ground-based experiments. Impacts with the COLLIDE and PRIME microgravity experiments showed mass transfer at speeds &lt; 40 cm/s into JSC-1 lunar regolith simulant and quartz sand targets.

This regolith evolves in a low ambient pressure and low-gravity environment. Its response to low-velocity impacts, such as those that may accompany human and robotic exploration activities, may be completely different than what is encountered on Earth. Experimental studies of the response of planetary regolith in the relevant environmental conditions are thus necessary to facilitate future Solar System exploration activities.We combined the results and provided new data analysis elements for a series of impact experiments into simulated planetary regolith in low-gravity conditions using two experimental setups and a range of microgravity platforms. The Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment (PRIME) flew on several parabolic aircraft flights, enabling the recording of impacts into granular materials at speeds of \u223c 4\u2013230 cm/s. The COLLisions Into Dust Experiment (COLLIDE) is conceptually close to the PRIME setup. It flew on the Space Shuttle in 1998 and 2001 and more recently on the Blue Origin New Shepard rocket, recording impacts into simulated regolith at speeds between 1 and 120 cm/s.Results of these experimental campaigns found that there is a significant change in the regolith behavior with the gravity environment. In a 10 <SUP>\u20112</SUP>g environment (with g being the gravity acceleration at the surface of the Earth), only embedding of the impactor was observed and ejecta production was produced for most impacts at &gt; 20 cm/s. Once at microgravity levels (&lt;10<SUP>\u20114</SUP>g), the lowest impact energies also produced impactor rebound. In these microgravity conditions, ejecta started to be produced for impacts at &gt; 10 cm/s. The measured ejecta speeds were somewhat lower than the ones measured at reduced-gravity levels, but the ejected masses were higher. In general, the mean ejecta velocity shows a power-law dependence on the impact energy with an index of \u223c 0.5. When projectile rebound occurred, we observed that its coefficients of restitution on the bed of regolith simulant decrease by a factor of 10 with increasing impact speeds from \u223c 5 up to 100 cm/s. We could also observe an increased cohesion between the JSC-1 grains compared to the quartz sand targets.",

In laboratory experiments we simulated the formation, evolution, and properties of decimetre-scale dusty bodies in protoplanetary discs. Small sub-mm size dust aggregates consisting of micron-size SiO2 particles randomly interacted with dust targets of varying initial conditions in a continuous sequence of independent collisions. Impact velocities were 7.7 m/s on average and in the range expected for collisions with decimetre bodies in protoplanetary discs. The targets all evolved by forming dust crusts with up to several cm thickness and a unique filling factor of 31% \u00b1 3%. A part of the projectiles sticks directly. In addition, some projectile fragments slowly return to the target by gravity. All initially porous parts of the surface, i.e. built from the slowly returning fragments, are compacted and firmly attached to the underlying dust layers by the subsequent impacts. Growth is possible at impact angles from 0\u00b0 (central collision) to 70\u00b0. No growth occurs at steeper dust surfaces. We measured the velocity, angle, and size distribution of collision fragments. The average restitution coefficient is 3.8% or 0.29 m/s ejection velocity. Ejecta sizes are comparable to the projectile sizes. The high filling factor is close to the most compact configuration of dust aggregates by local compression (~33%). This implies that the history of the surface formation and target growth is completely erased. In view of this, the filling factor of 31% seems to be a universal value in the collision experiments of all self-consistently evolving targets at the given impact velocities. We suggest that decimetre and probably larger bodies can simply be characterised by one single filling factor. While gravity dominates re-accretion in the experiments, small fragments will be re-accreted as well in protoplanetary discs by gas drag at the given low ejection velocities. The accretion efficiency in planetesimal growth is model dependent. However, a small fraction of small particles re-accreted by gas flow or direct sticking readily allows growth of dusty bodies in protoplanetary discs in the decimetre range.",

Specifically, we describe an impact erosion limit. We observed individual basalt beads, each measuring 0.5 mm in diameter, colliding with and either eroding or adhering to a cluster several centimetres in size. This cluster, formed from tribocharged particles, simulates an electrostatic growth phase that surpasses the classical bouncing barrier. We found a threshold velocity of about 0.5 m s<SUP>\u22121</SUP>, which separates additive and erosive impacts of individual beads. Numerical simulations of grains impacting clusters, for both low and high charge constituents, corroborate the experimental findings of surface erosion within the observed velocity range.

      "abstract": "Observations of proto-planetary disks, as well as theoretical modeling, suggest that in the late stages of accretion leading up to the formation of planetesimals, particles grew to pebbles the size of 1-mm to tens of cm, depending on the location and ambient conditions in the disk. That is the same size range that dominates the present-day comet and primitive asteroid mass loss. Meteoroids that size cause visible meteors on Earth. Here, we hypothesize that the size distribution and the physical and chemical properties of young meteoroid streams still contain information about the conditions in the solar nebula during these late stages of accretion towards planetesimal formation. If so, they constrain where long-period (Oort Cloud) comets, Jupiter-family (Scattered Disk Kuiper Belt) comets, and primitive asteroids (Asteroid Belt) formed. From video and visual observations of 47 young meteor showers, we find that freshly ejected meteoroids from long-period comets tend to have low bulk density and are distributed with equal surface area per log-mass interval (magnitude distribution index \u03c7 \u223c 1.85), suggesting gentle accretion conditions. Jupiter-family comets, on the other hand, mostly produce meteoroids twice as dense and distributed with a steeper \u03c7 \u223c 2.15 or even \u03c7 \u223c 2.5, which implies that those pebbles grew from particles fragmenting in a collisional cascade or by catastrophic collisions, respectively. Some primitive asteroids show \u03c7 &gt; 2.5, with most mass in small particles, indicating an even more aggressive fragmentation by processes other than mutual collisions. Both comet populations contain an admixture of compact materials that are sometimes sodium-poor, but Jupiter-family comets show a higher percentage (\u223c8% on average) than long-period comet showers (\u223c4%) and a wider range of percentages among comets. While there are exceptions in both groups, the implication is that most long-period comets formed under gentle particle growth conditions, possibly near the 30 AU edge of the Trans Neptunian Disk, while most Jupiter family comets formed closer to the Sun where pebbles reached or passed the fragmentation barrier, and primitive asteroids formed in the region where the cores of the giant planets formed. This is possible if the Scattered Disk represents all objects scattered by Neptune during its migration, while the present-day outer Oort cloud formed only during and after the time of the planet instability, well after the Sun had moved away from sibling stars.",

Dust dynamics and growth are also included in the simulations. <BR /> Results: We found that the dust growth from ~1 \u00b5m to 1-10 mm already occurs in the initial few thousand years of disk evolution but the Stokes number hardly exceeds 0.1 because of higher disk densities and temperatures compared to the minimum mass Solar nebular. The ratio of the dust-to-gas vertical scale heights remains rather modest, 0.2-0.5, which may be explained by the perturbing action of spiral arms that develop in the disk soon after its formation. The dust-to-gas mass ratio in the disk midplane is highly nonhomogeneous throughout the disk extent and is in general enhanced by a factor of several compared to the fiducial 1:100 value. Low St hinders strong dust accumulation in the spiral arms compared to the rest of the disk and the nonsteady nature of the spirals is also an obstacle. The spatial distribution of pebbles in the disk midplane exhibits a highly nonhomogeneous and patchy character. The total mass of pebbles in the disk increases with time and reaches a few tens of Earth masses after a few tens of thousand years of disk evolution. <BR /> Conclusions: We found that protoplanetary disks with an age \u226420 kyr can possess notable amounts of pebbles and feature dust-togas density enhancements in the disk midplane. Hence, these young disks can already be ripe for the planet formation process to start.

We study how such a pressure maximum collects dust aggregates and transforms them into large planetesimals and Moon-mass cores that can further grow into a few Earth-mass planets by pebble accretion, and eventually into giant planets by accreting a gaseous envelope. <BR /> Methods: We developed a numerical model, incorporating the evolution of a gaseous disc, the growth and transport of pebbles, N-body interactions of growing planetary cores, and their backreaction to a gas disc by opening a partial gap. Planetesimal formation by streaming instability is parametrised in our model. <BR /> Results: A transient pressure maximum efficiently accumulates dust particles that can grow larger than millimetre-sized. If this happens, dust aggregates can be transformed by the streaming instability process into large planetesimals, which can grow further by pebble accretion according to our assumptions. As the gas evolves towards a steady state, the pressure maximum vanishes, and the concentrated pebbles not transformed into planetesimals and accreted by the growing planet drift inward. During this inward drift, if the conditions of the streaming instability are met, planetesimals are formed in the disc within a wide radial range. <BR /> Conclusions: A transient pressure maximum is a favourable place for planetesimal and planet formation during its lifetime and the concentration of pebbles induces continuous formation of planetesimals even after its disappearance.

The composition, size, and shape of the growing aggregates determine the efficiency of this early growth. In particular, it has been proposed that fluffy ice aggregates can grow very efficiently in protoplanetary disks, suffering less from the bouncing and radial drift barriers. <BR /> Aims: While the collision velocity between icy aggregates of similar size is thought to stay below the fragmentation threshold, they may nonetheless lose mass from collisions with much smaller projectiles. As a result, erosive collisions have the potential to terminate the growth of pre-planetesimal bodies. We investigate the effect of these erosive collisions on the ability of porous ice aggregates to cross the radial drift barrier. <BR /> Methods: We develop a Monte Carlo code that calculates the evolution of the masses and porosities of growing aggregates, while resolving the entire mass distribution at all times. The aggregate's porosity is treated independently of its mass, and is determined by collisional compaction, gas compaction, and eventually self-gravity compaction. We include erosive collisions and study the effect of the erosion threshold velocity on aggregate growth. <BR /> Results: For erosion threshold velocities of 20-40 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>, high-velocity collisions with small projectiles prevent the largest aggregates from growing when they start to drift. In these cases, our local simulations result in a steady-state distribution, with most of the dust mass in particles with Stokes numbers close to unity. Only for the highest erosion threshold considered (60 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>) do porous aggregates manage to cross the radial drift barrier in the inner 10 AU of MMSN-like disks. <BR /> Conclusions: Erosive collisions are more effective in limiting the growth than fragmentary collisions between similar-size particles. Conceivably, erosion limits the growth before the radial drift barrier, although the robustness of this statement depends on uncertain material properties of icy aggregates.

It describes erosion as a limiting growth factor, however, it does not explicitly mention any numerical simulations or experiments relating to the main paper's focus. It is somewhat relevant but tangential to the main paper.",
