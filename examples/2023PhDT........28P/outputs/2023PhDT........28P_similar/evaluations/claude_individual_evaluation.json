      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it is the main paper being evaluated. It describes the methodology and findings of the authors in identifying active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies using optimized emission line diagnostics."
    },
    "2": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is also highly relevant as it is a follow-up study by the same authors, providing a multiwavelength census of dwarf AGN in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, building upon the findings and methodology of the main paper."
    },
    "3": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant as it discusses the identification of obscured AGN at high redshifts using mid-infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. However, it is focused on a different redshift range and methodology compared to the main paper, which concentrates on nearby dwarf galaxies and optical emission line diagnostics."
    },
    "4": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant as it investigates AGN in dwarf galaxies using multiwavelength data, including X-ray observations from Chandra and mid-infrared data from WISE. However, it does not specifically address the emission line diagnostic methods discussed in the main paper."
    },
    "5": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant as it presents a modified emission line classification scheme to identify AGN candidates, including a new category of 'star-forming AGN' (SF-AGN), similar to the approach used in the main paper. However, it is focused on the RESOLVE survey data, whereas the main paper combines RESOLVE and ECO survey data."
    },
    "6": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant as it investigates the mid-infrared colors of dwarf galaxies and their potential for identifying AGN, which is related to the multiwavelength approach used in the main paper. However, it does not directly address the optical emission line diagnostics, which are the primary focus of the main paper."
    },
    "7": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant as it presents a catalog of physical properties for galaxies from the DESI survey, including AGN identification. However, it does not specifically focus on dwarf galaxies or the emission line diagnostic methods discussed in the main paper."
    },
    "8": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant as it presents a versatile classification tool for galactic activity using optical and infrared colors, which is related to the multiwavelength approach used in the main paper. However, it does not specifically address the emission line diagnostic methods or the focus on dwarf galaxies."
    },
    "9": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant as it investigates AGN activity in dwarf galaxies using mid-infrared variability, which is a complementary approach to the optical emission line diagnostics discussed in the main paper. However, it does not directly address the emission line diagnostic methods."
    },
    "10": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant as it presents a sample of variability-selected AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies, which is related to the goal of identifying AGN in dwarf galaxies in the main paper. However, it does not specifically address the emission line diagnostic methods, which are the primary focus of the main paper."

    "weaknesses": [
      "Some results are tangential to the main paper's focus, either addressing different redshift ranges or methodologies.",

    "suggestions": [
      "Future searches could focus more specifically on results that address the emission line diagnostic methods for identifying AGN in dwarf galaxies, as this is the primary focus of the main paper.",
