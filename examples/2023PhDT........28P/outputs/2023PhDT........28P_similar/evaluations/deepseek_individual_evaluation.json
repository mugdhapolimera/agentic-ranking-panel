    "1": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This paper directly aligns with the main paper's methodology, using the same RESOLVE/ECO surveys and a multi-diagnostic approach ([O III]/H\u03b2 vs. [S II]/H\u03b1 and [O I]/H\u03b1) to identify SF-AGN in low-metallicity dwarfs. It explicitly addresses the same challenge of missed AGN in traditional BPT diagnostics and reports similar AGN percentages (~3\u201316%)."
    },
    "2": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This is a companion paper to Result 1, expanding the multi-diagnostic AGN census in RESOLVE/ECO to include mid-IR data. It reinforces the main paper's findings on SF-AGN prevalence in dwarfs and provides complementary statistics (~5\u20138% combined AGN frequency). The focus on metallicity and SF-AGN properties matches the main paper\u2019s themes."
    },
    "3": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "While this paper identifies obscured AGN, it focuses on high-redshift galaxies (z \u223c 3\u20135) using JWST/MIRI data, differing from the main paper's z \u223c 0 dwarf galaxy focus and optical diagnostics. The methodology (mid-IR SEDs) and redshift regime make it tangential."
    },
    "4": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Relevant to AGN identification in dwarfs but focuses on WISE mid-IR color selection, which the main paper also critiques. The conclusion that WISE colors alone are unreliable for dwarfs supports the main paper\u2019s argument for multi-diagnostic optical methods. However, it does not address SF-AGN or RESOLVE/ECO."
    },
    "5": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "Directly extends the main paper\u2019s work by applying the same multi-diagnostic scheme to RESOLVE. It identifies SF-AGN and reports similar AGN percentages (~5.2% in dwarfs), validating the methodology. The discussion of gas-rich dwarfs and follow-up confirmation aligns with the main paper\u2019s goals."
    },
    "6": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Addresses AGN identification challenges in dwarfs but focuses on mid-IR color contamination by starbursts. While relevant to the main paper\u2019s theme, it critiques WISE-based methods rather than supporting the optical multi-diagnostic approach. Highlights pitfalls the main paper\u2019s method avoids."
    },
    "7": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Focuses on SED fitting with WISE data and AGN misclassification in star-forming galaxies. While related to AGN identification, it does not address dwarf galaxies, RESOLVE/ECO, or the multi-diagnostic approach. Limited relevance beyond general AGN classification."
    },
    "8": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Presents a unified AGN classification tool using WISE and SDSS colors. Though methodologically distinct from the main paper\u2019s emission-line diagnostics, it shares the goal of improving AGN identification in diverse galaxies. The inclusion of passive galaxies makes it broader in scope."
    },
    "9": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Uses mid-IR variability to confirm AGN in dwarfs, a different methodology than the main paper\u2019s optical diagnostics. However, it addresses the same population (low-mass, low-metallicity dwarfs) and validates AGN activity, offering complementary insights."
    },
    "10": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Identifies AGN via optical/mid-IR variability in dwarfs, a method orthogonal to the main paper\u2019s approach. While relevant to AGN demographics in dwarfs, the focus on variability rather than emission-line diagnostics limits direct alignment. Highlights alternative techniques for AGN discovery."
