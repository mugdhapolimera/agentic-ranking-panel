  "title": "Investigating Active Galactic Nuclei in Dwarf and Giant Galaxies in the Nearby Universe",
  "abstract": "Understanding the occurrence and properties of actively accreting black holes, known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), is crucial for unraveling the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies across different mass scales. However, existing classification systems for identifying AGN based on optical emission-line diagnostics are primarily optimized for giant galaxies with stellar masses, M\u2217 &gt; 109.5 M\u2299. This poses a significant challenge in detecting AGN in low-metallicity and highly star-forming galaxies, particularly typical z\u223c0 dwarfs. In this work, we uncover AGN in dwarfs that have strong emission lines using a multi-diagnostic classification system that optimizes the use of existing optical diagnostics. Our multi-diagnostic system is more robust and systematic, providing a consistent categorization of galaxies that lack unique classifications. This systematic approach enables the identification of a hidden population of AGN candidates, referred to as Star Forming-AGN (SF-AGN), in metal-poor, gas-rich, star-forming dwarfs at z\u223c0. We apply this system to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys and discover that the percentage of optical AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines ranges from \u223c3-15%, which significantly exceeds previous estimates of \u223c1%.To investigate the frequency of actively accreting black holes in the nearby Universe, we compile a comprehensive inventory of AGN in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, using optical emission line diagnostics, including our multi-diagnostic approach for identifying SF-AGN, and mid-IR color-selection using WISE colors. The statistical completeness of the RESOLVE and ECO surveys allows us to calculate accurate AGN occupation fractions, representing the number of AGN relative to the total number of galaxies within the survey volume, including those that did not meet the criteria for any AGN search sample. Among the entire galaxy population, the percentage of optical and mid-IR AGN in dwarfs is approximately \u223c3-5%, whereas in giants it ranges from \u223c20-33%. Notably, the dwarf AGN percentage is at least double the previous estimates, while the AGN occurrence in giants is consistent with earlier studies. A key finding of this research is that AGN hosted by typical z\u223c0 dwarfs are predominantly classified as SF-AGN or WISE AGN.Subsequently, we extend the optical multi-diagnostic AGN classification system to a large archival dataset based on the SDSS footprint, encompassing 10\u00d7 the number of galaxies. Similar to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, we observe that over half of the dwarf AGN in the archival sample fall into the newly identified SFAGN category. Leveraging the statistical power of this archival dataset, we investigate the relationship between galaxy compactness and AGN activity as a function of mass. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between compactness and AGN percentage in a mass regime where galaxies are transitioning between dwarfs and giants.",

      "abstract": "Existing star-forming vs. active galactic nucleus (AGN) classification schemes using optical emission-line diagnostics mostly fail for low-metallicity and/or highly star-forming galaxies, missing AGN in typical z ~ 0 dwarfs. To recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey emission-line catalogs overlapping the volume- and mass-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntex (ECO) surveys to determine the AGN percentage in SEL dwarfs. Our photoionization grids show that the [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [S II]/H\u03b1 diagram (S II plot) and [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [O I]/H\u03b1 diagram (O I plot) are less metallicity sensitive and more successful in identifying dwarf AGN than the popular [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [N II]/H\u03b1 diagnostic (N II plot or \"BPT diagram\"). We identify a new category of \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN) classified as star-forming by the N II plot but as AGN by the S II and/or O I plots. Including SF-AGN, we find the z ~ 0 AGN percentage in dwarfs with SELs to be ~3%-16%, far exceeding most previous optical estimates (~1%). The large range in our dwarf AGN percentage reflects differences in spectral fitting methodologies between catalogs. The highly complete nature of RESOLVE and ECO allows us to normalize strong emission-line galaxy statistics to the full galaxy population, reducing the dwarf AGN percentage to ~0.6%-3.0%. The newly identified SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs with halo mass &lt;10<SUP>11.5</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>, where highly efficient cosmic gas accretion is expected.

      "abstract": "We provide a multiwavelength census of dwarf Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the volume- and mass-limited RESOLVE and ECO surveys using mid-IR colours, the BPT diagnostic plot with both traditional and alternative demarcations from literature, and our new multi-diagnostic approach revealing the previously overlooked \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN). Emission line flux ratios of SF-AGN position them as star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram but as AGN in at least one of two other diagnostic plots using [OI]/H\u03b1 or [SII]/H\u03b1 instead of the metallicity-sensitive [NII]/H\u03b1 used in the BPT diagram. SF-AGN are common in local dwarf galaxies, and photoionization models confirm their line ratio patterns match those of model low-metallicity, highly star-forming dwarf galaxies with active intermediate-mass black holes. Given the statistically complete nature of these surveys down to baryonic (stellar+gas) masses of ~10<SUP>9.2</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, they give us the opportunity to quote full-population AGN statistics previously unavailable in the dwarf regime. The addition of SF-AGN and bonus AGN from the alternative BPT plot quadruples the optical dwarf AGN percentage from ~1% to ~4% of the full galaxy population (including non-emission line galaxies). Mid-IR colours also identify up to ~4% of all dwarfs as AGN, albeit the status of the mid-IR AGN candidates is less secure than the optical AGN. We find little overlap between methods, hinting at the possibility that they identify AGN hosts at different evolutionary stages. The bonus dwarf AGN from the alternative BPT method mostly have relatively high metallicity and low star formation activity for dwarfs. In contrast, the mid-IR and SF-AGN hosts have more typical metallicities and star formation rates. Assuming all AGN candidates to be valid, the combined multiwavelength z~0 dwarf AGN frequency is ~5-8%, implying that active accretion onto intermediate mass BHs in dwarf galaxies may be more widespread than previously realised, with implications for BH-galaxy coevolution. We further investigate the properties and environments of SF-AGN and their hosts.",

Data from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope provides an excellent opportunity to perform such studies. We take advantage of the MIRI imaging data from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey to investigate the AGN population in the distant universe. We estimate the source properties of MIRI-selected objects by utilizing spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling, and classify them into star-forming galaxies (SFs), SF-AGN mixed objects, and AGN. The source numbers of these types are 433, 102, and 25, respectively, from four MIRI pointings covering ~9 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP>. The sample spans a redshift range of \u22480-5. We derive the median SEDs for all three source types, respectively, and publicly release them. The median MIRI SED of AGN is similar to the typical SEDs of hot dust-obscured galaxies and Seyfert 2s, for which the mid-IR SEDs are dominated by emission from AGN-heated hot dust. Based on our SED-fit results, we estimate the black hole accretion density (BHAD; i.e., total BH growth rate per comoving volume) as a function of redshift. At z &lt; 3, the resulting BHAD agrees with the X-ray measurements in general. At z &gt; 3, we identify a total of 27 AGN and SF-AGN mixed objects, leading to that our high-z BHAD is substantially higher than the X-ray results (~0.5 dex at z \u2248 3-5).

Here we present Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of 11 dwarf galaxies that were chosen as AGN candidates using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mid-infrared (mid-IR) color-color selection. Hubble Space Telescope images are also presented for 10 of the galaxies. Based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy, six galaxies in our sample have optical evidence for hosting AGNs and five are classified as star-forming. We detect X-ray point sources with luminosities above that expected from X-ray binaries in the nuclei of five of the six galaxies with optical evidence of AGNs. However, the X-ray emission from these AGNs is generally much lower than expected based on AGN scaling relations with infrared and optical tracers. We do not find compelling evidence for AGNs in the five optically-selected star-forming galaxies despite having red mid-IR colors. Only two are detected in X-rays and their properties are consistent with stellar-mass X-ray binaries. Based on this multiwavelength study, we conclude that two-color mid-IR AGN diagnostics at the resolution of WISE cannot be used to reliably select AGNs in optically-star-forming dwarf galaxies.

This scheme uses a combination of the [NII]/H-alpha (BPT), [SII]/H-alpha, and [OI]/H-alpha emission line diagnostic plots. SF-AGN is a new category of AGN candidates that were previously classified inconsistently among the three diagnostics. Our new scheme aims to identify undetected AGN candidates among dwarf galaxies, determining a better lower limit for the z~0 massive black hole occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies. We use photoionization models to show that the [SII] and [OI] line diagnostics identify AGN in low metallicity dwarf galaxies that are missed by the BPT diagnostic, providing theoretical motivation for using our new scheme. We apply this scheme to galaxies in the z~0 RESOLVE survey, a statistically complete volume-limited census dominated by dwarfs (stellar mass &lt; 10<SUP>9.5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>). For initial classification, we use SDSS MPA-JHU line measurements with S/N &gt; 5 for all relevant emission lines. This S/N cut limits the ~1500 galaxy RESOLVE survey to a sample of 462 galaxies, of which 306 are dwarfs. Including SF-AGN, we find that 5.2% of dwarfs are AGN candidates, compared to 0.3% using the traditional AGN/composite classifications alone. The SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs having moderately high long-term star formation, but not necessarily recent starburst activity. We seek external confirmation of these results by comparisons to archival X-ray, mid-IR, and radio data. We also examine spatially resolved spectroscopy available from the RESOLVE and SAMI surveys for a subset of the candidates to check that AGN signatures appear only near the center of the galaxy.

We then investigate the infrared properties of optically selected star-forming dwarf galaxies, finding that the galaxies with the reddest infrared colors are the most compact, with blue optical colors, young stellar ages, and large specific star formation rates. These results indicate that great care must be taken when selecting AGNs in dwarf galaxies using infrared colors, as star-forming dwarf galaxies are capable of heating dust in such a way that mimics the infrared colors of more luminous AGNs. In particular, a simple W1-W2 color cut alone should not be used to select AGNs in dwarf galaxies.

Passive or dormant galaxies are often excluded from these diagnostics, which usually employ emission-line features (e.g., forbidden emission lines). Thus, most of them focus on specific types of activity or only on one activity class, for example active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies <BR /> Aims: In this work we used infrared and optical colors to build an all-inclusive galactic activity diagnostic tool that can discriminate between star-forming, AGN, low-ionization nuclear emission-line region, composite, and passive galaxies, and which can be used in local and low-redshift galaxies. <BR /> Methods: We used the random forest algorithm to define a new activity diagnostic tool. As the ground truth for the training of the algorithm, we considered galaxies that have been classified based on their optical spectral lines. We explored classification criteria based on infrared colors from the first three WISE bands (bands 1, 2, and 3) supplemented with optical colors from the u, g, and r SDSS bands. From them, we sought the combination with the minimum number of colors that provides optimal results. Furthermore, to mitigate biases related to aperture effects, we introduced a new WISE photometric scheme that combines apertures of different sizes. <BR /> Results: Using machine learning methods, we developed a diagnostic tool that accommodates both active and passive galaxies under one unified classification scheme using just three colors. We find that the combination of W1-W2, W2-W3, and g-r colors offers a good performance, while the broad availability of these colors for a large number of galaxies ensures it can be applied to large galaxy samples. The overall accuracy is ~81%, and the achieved completeness for each class is ~81% for star-forming, ~56% for AGN, ~68% for LINER, ~65% for composite, and ~85% for passive galaxies. <BR /> Conclusions: Our diagnostic represents a significant improvement over existing infrared diagnostics because it includes all types of active galaxies, as well as passive galaxies, extending their application to the local Universe. The inclusion of the optical colors improves its ability to identify low-luminosity AGN galaxies, which are generally confused with star-forming galaxies, and helps us identify cases of starbursts with extreme mid-infrared colors that mimic obscured AGN galaxies, a well-known problem for most infrared diagnostics.",

We also determined a nuclear supernova fraction of 0.05% \u00b1 0.01% yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for dwarf galaxies in ZTF. Our ZTF and WISE IMBH candidates show the promise of variability searches for the discovery of otherwise hidden low-mass AGN.",
