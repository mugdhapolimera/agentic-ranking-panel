    "1": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it focuses on identifying AGN in low-mass galaxies using the BPT diagram and broad-line diagnostics, directly aligning with the main paper's methodology and objectives. The study also addresses BH masses in low-mass hosts, a key aspect of the main paper's investigation."
    },
    "2": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This study directly complements the main paper by using the He II \u03bb4686 diagnostic to identify AGN in star-forming galaxies, which the main paper highlights as a method to overcome BPT limitations. The increase in AGN fraction and focus on low-mass hosts align closely with the main paper's goals."
    },
    "3": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "While focused on AGN in low-mass galaxies, this study uses optical variability (ZTF) rather than the main paper\u2019s optical/mid-IR diagnostics. The shared target population and AGN confirmation via spectra make it relevant, but methodological differences reduce alignment."
    },
    "4": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result investigates BH-galaxy scaling relations in low-mass AGN hosts, which relates to the main paper\u2019s broader context. However, it does not address AGN identification methods (BPT/He II/mid-IR), making it somewhat tangential to the main paper\u2019s core methodology."
    },
    "5": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "Highly relevant as it addresses challenges in distinguishing AGN from ULXs using emission-line diagnostics (including He II and [O I]), directly aligning with the main paper\u2019s focus on improving AGN selection in low-mass, star-forming galaxies."
    },
    "6": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Relevant due to its focus on AGN in dwarfs using WISE mid-IR and X-ray validation, but it critiques mid-IR diagnostics' reliability in star-forming dwarfs. This aligns with the main paper\u2019s discussion of selection biases but diverges methodologically by emphasizing X-ray follow-up."
    },
    "7": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Focuses on AGN-star formation correlations in local galaxies but does not specifically target low-mass systems or use the main paper\u2019s diagnostics (BPT/He II/mid-IR). The tangential connection to AGN activity in star-forming hosts keeps it marginally relevant."
    },
    "8": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "Highly relevant as it employs multi-diagnostic methods (BPT, coronal lines) to identify AGN in low-mass galaxies, aligning with the main paper\u2019s approach. The extension to higher redshifts and deeper spectroscopy also parallels the main paper\u2019s emphasis on completeness."
    },
    "9": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Primarily focuses on X-ray-selected AGN in a large survey, diverging from the main paper\u2019s optical/mid-IR methods. While AGN selection is a shared theme, the lack of emphasis on low-mass galaxies and different diagnostics reduce relevance."
    },
    "10": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "Directly aligns with the main paper by using He II diagnostics in MaNGA data to uncover AGN in star-forming galaxies, addressing BPT limitations. The focus on spatially resolved AGN in low-mass hosts and incompleteness corrections strengthens methodological alignment."

  "overall_analysis": {
    "strengths": [
      "Multiple results (1, 2, 5, 8, 10) closely align with the main paper\u2019s focus on AGN identification in low-mass galaxies using BPT, He II, and multi-diagnostic approaches.",
      "Results 2 and 10 explicitly validate the utility of He II diagnostics in star-forming environments, reinforcing the main paper\u2019s methodology.",
      "Several studies (5, 6, 8) address selection biases and challenges in AGN identification, complementing the main paper\u2019s discussion."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Some results (3, 9) use divergent methodologies (variability, X-ray selection) that do not directly address the main paper\u2019s optical/mid-IR focus.",
      "A few studies (4, 7) focus on tangential aspects (scaling relations, AGN-star formation links) rather than AGN detection methods."
    ],
    "suggestions": [
      "Include X-ray or radio follow-up data to validate AGN candidates identified via optical/mid-IR methods, as suggested by Results 6 and 9.",
      "Explore variability-based AGN selection (as in Result 3) to complement traditional diagnostics and improve completeness.",
      "Expand the discussion of BH-galaxy scaling relations (Result 4) to contextualize AGN demographics in low-mass hosts."
