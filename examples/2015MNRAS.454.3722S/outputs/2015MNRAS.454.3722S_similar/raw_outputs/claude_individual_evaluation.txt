        "3": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it discusses the use of optical variability to uncover AGN in low-mass galaxies, which is another method relevant to the main paper's topic."},
        "4": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant as it discusses the relationship between black hole mass and total stellar mass in galaxies, which is related to the topic of AGN in low-mass galaxies. However, it is not as closely aligned with the main paper's methodology."},
        "5": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant as it discusses emission line diagnostics for identifying intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies, which is related to the main paper's topic. However, it focuses more on the modeling aspect rather than the observational data analysis approach used in the main paper."},
        "6": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it uses a multiwavelength approach, including Chandra X-ray and Hubble Space Telescope data, to study AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies, which is closely aligned with the main paper's topic and methodology."},

However, it does not specifically focus on the low-mass regime or the emission line diagnostic methods used in the main paper."},
        "8": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it presents a new sample of low-mass galaxies with AGN signatures, identified using emission line diagnostics, which is directly aligned with the main paper's topic and methodology."},
        "9": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant as it discusses a spectroscopic survey of X-ray-selected AGN, which is related to the topic of AGN identification. However, it does not specifically focus on low-mass galaxies or the optical emission line diagnostic methods used in the main paper."},
        "10": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it uses the He II emission line diagnostic to identify hidden AGN in star-forming galaxies, which is one of the key methods discussed in the main paper."}
