  "abstract": "We investigated AGN activity in low-mass galaxies, an important regime that can shed light on to black hole (BH) formation and evolution, and their interaction with their host galaxies. We identified 336 AGN candidates from a parent sample of \u223c48 000 nearby low-mass galaxies (M<SUB>*</SUB> \u2264 10<SUP>9.5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, z &lt; 0.1) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We selected the AGN using the classical BPT diagram, a similar optical emission line diagnostic based on the He II \u03bb4686 line, and mid-IR colour cuts. Different criteria select host galaxies with different physical properties such as stellar mass and optical colour and only 3 out of 336 sources fulfil all three criteria. This could be in part due to selection biases. The resulting AGN fraction of \u223c0.7 per cent is at least one order of magnitude below the one estimated for more massive galaxies. At optical wavelengths, the He II-based AGN selection appears to be more sensitive to AGN hosted in star-forming galaxies than the classical BPT diagram, at least in the low-mass regime. The archival X-ray and radio data available for some of the AGN candidates seem to confirm their AGN nature, but follow-up observations are needed to confirm the AGN nature of the rest of the sample, especially in the case of mid-IR selection. Our sample will be important for future follow-up studies aiming to understand the relation between BHs and host galaxies in the low-mass regime.",

      "abstract": "Context. The origins of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of massive galaxies are a topic of intense investigation. One way to address this subject is to identify the seeds of SMBHs as intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; 100 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> &lt; M<SUB>BH</SUB> &lt; 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>). IMBHs are expected to be found at the centers of low stellar mass galaxies (LSMGs). Aims. Our goal is to complete the census of SMBHs in LSMGs. In this work our aim is to establish the purity of active galactic nucleus (AGN) selection by algorithms based on optical variability and to characterize the black hole population found through this method. Methods. We used random forest algorithms to classify all objects in a large portion of the sky, using optical light curves obtained from, or built from images provided by, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We compared different selection sets based on alerts (flux changes with at least 5\u03c3 significance) or complete light curves derived from different photometric selection algorithms. The AGN candidates thus selected were cross-matched with objects in the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) of local galaxies, with M<SUB>*</SUB> &lt; 2 \u00d7 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. The AGN nature of these candidates was verified and characterized using archival optical spectra from SDSS. We further established the fraction of candidates with counterparts in the eROSITA Data Release 1 catalog of X-ray sources. Results. From an initial sample of 506 candidates, 415 have good-quality spectra. Among these 415 objects we found significant broad Balmer lines in the spectra for 86% (357) of the candidates. When considering BPT classifications, five additional candidates were confirmed, resulting in 87% (362) confirmed candidates. Specifically, broad Balmer lines were detected in 94%\u201398% of the AGN candidates selected from complete light curves and in 80% of those selected from the less frequent ZTF alerts. The black hole masses estimated from the spectra range from 2.2 \u00d7 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> to 4.2 \u00d7 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, reaching lower values for the candidates selected using the more sensitive light curves. The black hole masses obtained cluster around 0.1% of the stellar mass of the host from the NSA catalog. Two-thirds of the AGN candidates are classified as Seyfert or composite by their narrow emission line ratios (BPT diagnostics), while the rest are star-forming. Almost all the candidates classified as Seyfert and over 50% of those classified as star-forming have significant broad emission lines (BELs). We found X-ray counterparts for 67% of the candidates that fall in the footprint of the eROSITA-DE DR1. Considering only the candidates with significant BELs, the matches increase to 75%, regardless of where they appear in the BPT diagnostics diagrams.",

      "abstract": "Dwarf AGN serve as the ideal systems for identifying intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) down to the most elusive regimes ($\\sim 10^3 - 10^4 M_{\\odot}$). However, the ubiquitously metal-poor nature of dwarf galaxies gives rise to ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that can mimic the spectral signatures of IMBH excitation. We present a novel photoionization model suite that simultaneously incorporates IMBHs and ULXs in a metal-poor, highly star-forming environment. We account for changes in $M_{BH}$ according to formation seeding channels and metallicity, and changes in ULX populations with post-starburst age and metallicity. We find that broadband X-rays and UV emission lines are insensitive to $M_{BH}$ and largely unable to distinguish between ULXs and IMBHs. Many optical diagnostic diagrams cannot correctly identify dwarf AGN. The notable exceptions include He~II~$\u03bb$4686 and [O~I]~$\u03bb$6300, for which we redefine typical demarcations to account for ULX contributions. Emission lines in the mid-IR show the most promise in separating stellar, ULX, IMBH, and shock excitation while presenting sensitivity to $M_{BH}$ and $f_{\\text{AGN}}$. Overall, our results expose the potential biases in identifying and characterizing dwarf AGN purely on strong line ratios and diagnostic diagrams rather than holistically evaluating the entire spectrum. As a proof of concept, we argue that recently discovered over-massive BHs in high-$z$ JWST AGN might not represent the overall BH population, with many galaxies in these samples potentially being falsely classified as purely star-forming.",

Here we present Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of 11 dwarf galaxies that were chosen as AGN candidates using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mid-infrared (mid-IR) color-color selection. Hubble Space Telescope images are also presented for 10 of the galaxies. Based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy, six galaxies in our sample have optical evidence for hosting AGNs and five are classified as star-forming. We detect X-ray point sources with luminosities above that expected from X-ray binaries in the nuclei of five of the six galaxies with optical evidence of AGNs. However, the X-ray emission from these AGNs is generally much lower than expected based on AGN scaling relations with infrared and optical tracers. We do not find compelling evidence for AGNs in the five optically-selected star-forming galaxies despite having red mid-IR colors. Only two are detected in X-rays and their properties are consistent with stellar-mass X-ray binaries.

We followed up 3042 sources brighter than r = 22.5 mag with the SDSS Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) spectrograph. The spectra yielded a reliable redshift measurement for 2578 AGNs in the redshift range z = 0.02-5.0, with 0.5-2 keV luminosities ranging from 10<SUP>39</SUP>-10<SUP>46</SUP> erg s<SUP>- 1</SUP>. This is currently the largest published spectroscopic sample of X-ray-selected AGNs in a contiguous area. The BOSS spectra of AGN candidates show a distribution of optical line widths which is clearly bimodal, allowing an efficient separation between broad- and narrow-emission line AGNs. The former dominate our sample (70 per cent) due to the relatively bright X-ray flux limit and the optical BOSS magnitude limit. We classify the narrow-emission line objects (22 per cent of the full sample) using standard optical emission line diagnostics: the majority have line ratios indicating the dominant source of ionization is the AGN. A small number (8 per cent of the full sample) exhibit the typical narrow line ratios of star-forming galaxies, or only have absorption lines in their spectra. We term the latter two classes `elusive' AGN, which would not be easy to identify correctly without their X-ray emission. We also compare X-ray (XMM-Newton), optical colour (SDSS) and and IR (WISE) AGN selections in this field. X-ray observations reveal, by far, the largest number of AGN. The overlap between the selections, which is a strong function of the imaging depth in a given band, is also remarkably small. We show using spectral stacking that a large fraction of the X-ray AGNs would not be selectable via optical or IR colours due to host galaxy contamination. A substantial fraction of AGN may therefore be missed by these longer wavelength selection methods.",

      "abstract": "Nebular He II \u03bb4686 \u00c5 line emission is useful to unveil active galactic nuclei (AGN) residing in actively star-forming (SF) galaxies, typically missed by the standard BPT classification. Here, we adopt the He II diagnostic to identify hidden AGN in the Local Universe using for the first time spatially resolved data from the Data Release 15 of the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO survey (MaNGA DR15). By combining results from He II and BPT diagnostics, we overall select 459 AGN host candidates (~10 per cent in MaNGA DR15), out of which 27 are identified as AGN by the He II diagram only. The He II-only AGN population is hosted by massive (M<SUB>*</SUB> \u2273 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) SF Main Sequence galaxies and on average less luminous than the BPT-selected AGN. Given the He II line faintness, we revisit our census accounting for incompleteness effects due to the He II sensitivity limit of MaNGA. We thus obtain an overall increased fraction (11 per cent) of AGN in MaNGA compared to the BPT-only census (9 per cent), which further increases to 14 per cent for galaxies more massive than 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>; interestingly, on the SF Main Sequence the increase is by about a factor of 2. A substantial number of AGN in SF galaxies points to significant, coeval star formation and black hole accretion, consistently with results from hydrodynamical simulations and with important implications on quenching scenarios. In view of exploring unprecedented high redshifts with JWST and new ground-based facilities, revisiting the standard BPT classification through novel emission-line diagnostics is fundamental to discover AGN in highly SF environments.",
