  "title": "Finding Low-Metallicity Dwarf AGN Candidates at z 0 using the RESOLVE Survey",
  "abstract": "We present a modified emission line classification scheme to categorize galaxies as definite star forming, composite, AGN, or star-forming AGN (SF-AGN). This scheme uses a combination of the [NII]/H-alpha (BPT), [SII]/H-alpha, and [OI]/H-alpha emission line diagnostic plots. SF-AGN is a new category of AGN candidates that were previously classified inconsistently among the three diagnostics. Our new scheme aims to identify undetected AGN candidates among dwarf galaxies, determining a better lower limit for the z~0 massive black hole occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies. We use photoionization models to show that the [SII] and [OI] line diagnostics identify AGN in low metallicity dwarf galaxies that are missed by the BPT diagnostic, providing theoretical motivation for using our new scheme. We apply this scheme to galaxies in the z~0 RESOLVE survey, a statistically complete volume-limited census dominated by dwarfs (stellar mass &lt; 10<SUP>9.5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>). For initial classification, we use SDSS MPA-JHU line measurements with S/N &gt; 5 for all relevant emission lines. This S/N cut limits the ~1500 galaxy RESOLVE survey to a sample of 462 galaxies, of which 306 are dwarfs. Including SF-AGN, we find that 5.2% of dwarfs are AGN candidates, compared to 0.3% using the traditional AGN/composite classifications alone. The SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs having moderately high long-term star formation, but not necessarily recent starburst activity. We seek external confirmation of these results by comparisons to archival X-ray, mid-IR, and radio data. We also examine spatially resolved spectroscopy available from the RESOLVE and SAMI surveys for a subset of the candidates to check that AGN signatures appear only near the center of the galaxy. This work sets the stage for follow-up studies of dwarf AGN black hole occupancy, outflows, and mixing fractions of star formation and AGN activity.",

      "abstract": "Existing star-forming vs. active galactic nucleus (AGN) classification schemes using optical emission-line diagnostics mostly fail for low-metallicity and/or highly star-forming galaxies, missing AGN in typical z ~ 0 dwarfs. To recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey emission-line catalogs overlapping the volume- and mass-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntex (ECO) surveys to determine the AGN percentage in SEL dwarfs. Our photoionization grids show that the [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [S II]/H\u03b1 diagram (S II plot) and [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [O I]/H\u03b1 diagram (O I plot) are less metallicity sensitive and more successful in identifying dwarf AGN than the popular [O III]/H\u03b2 versus [N II]/H\u03b1 diagnostic (N II plot or \"BPT diagram\"). We identify a new category of \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN) classified as star-forming by the N II plot but as AGN by the S II and/or O I plots. Including SF-AGN, we find the z ~ 0 AGN percentage in dwarfs with SELs to be ~3%-16%, far exceeding most previous optical estimates (~1%). The large range in our dwarf AGN percentage reflects differences in spectral fitting methodologies between catalogs. The highly complete nature of RESOLVE and ECO allows us to normalize strong emission-line galaxy statistics to the full galaxy population, reducing the dwarf AGN percentage to ~0.6%-3.0%. The newly identified SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs with halo mass &lt;10<SUP>11.5</SUP> M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>, where highly efficient cosmic gas accretion is expected. Almost all SF-AGN also have low metallicities (Z \u2272 0.4 Z <SUB>\u2299</SUB>), demonstrating the advantage of our method.",

      "abstract": "We provide a multiwavelength census of dwarf Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the volume- and mass-limited RESOLVE and ECO surveys using mid-IR colours, the BPT diagnostic plot with both traditional and alternative demarcations from literature, and our new multi-diagnostic approach revealing the previously overlooked \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN). Emission line flux ratios of SF-AGN position them as star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram but as AGN in at least one of two other diagnostic plots using [OI]/H\u03b1 or [SII]/H\u03b1 instead of the metallicity-sensitive [NII]/H\u03b1 used in the BPT diagram. SF-AGN are common in local dwarf galaxies, and photoionization models confirm their line ratio patterns match those of model low-metallicity, highly star-forming dwarf galaxies with active intermediate-mass black holes. Given the statistically complete nature of these surveys down to baryonic (stellar+gas) masses of ~10<SUP>9.2</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, they give us the opportunity to quote full-population AGN statistics previously unavailable in the dwarf regime. The addition of SF-AGN and bonus AGN from the alternative BPT plot quadruples the optical dwarf AGN percentage from ~1% to ~4% of the full galaxy population (including non-emission line galaxies). Mid-IR colours also identify up to ~4% of all dwarfs as AGN, albeit the status of the mid-IR AGN candidates is less secure than the optical AGN. We find little overlap between methods, hinting at the possibility that they identify AGN hosts at different evolutionary stages. The bonus dwarf AGN from the alternative BPT method mostly have relatively high metallicity and low star formation activity for dwarfs. In contrast, the mid-IR and SF-AGN hosts have more typical metallicities and star formation rates. Assuming all AGN candidates to be valid, the combined multiwavelength z~0 dwarf AGN frequency is ~5-8%, implying that active accretion onto intermediate mass BHs in dwarf galaxies may be more widespread than previously realised, with implications for BH-galaxy coevolution. We further investigate the properties and environments of SF-AGN and their hosts.",

      "abstract": "The finding of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies has important implications for galaxy evolution and supermassive black hole formation models. Yet, how AGNs in dwarf galaxies form is still debated, in part due to scant demographics. We use the MaNGA survey, comprising ~10 000 galaxies at z &lt; 0.15, to identify AGN dwarf galaxies using a spaxel-by-spaxel classification in three spatially-resolved emission-line diagnostic diagrams (the [N II]-, [S II]-, and [O I]-BPT) and the WHAN diagram. This yields a sample of 664 AGN dwarf galaxies, the largest to date, and an AGN fraction of $\\sim 20~{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$ that is significantly larger than that of single-fibre-spectroscopy studies (i.e. $\\sim 1~{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$). This can be explained by the lower bolometric luminosity (&lt;10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and accretion rate (sub-Eddington) of the MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies. We additionally identify 1176 SF-AGNs (classified as star-forming in the [N II]-BPT but as AGNs in the [S II]- and [O I]-BPT), 122 Composite, and 173 LINER sources. The offset between the optical centre of the galaxy and the median position of the AGN spaxels is more than 3 arcsec for ~62% of the AGNs, suggesting that some could be off-nuclear. We also identify seven new broad-line AGNs with log M<SUB>BH</SUB> = 5.0-5.9 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. Our results show how integral-field spectroscopy is a powerful tool for uncovering faint and low-accretion AGNs and better constraining the demographics of AGNs in dwarf galaxies.",

The sample was obtained from a match of the SRG/eROSITA X-ray catalogue in the eastern galactic hemisphere with the MPA-JHU SDSS catalogue. The obtained matches were cleaned rigorously with the help of external optical catalogues to increase the purity of the sample. This work is the largest study of this kind - X-ray activity in \u224885 per cent of matched dwarfs was not reported before. The majority of X-ray active dwarfs are identified as star-forming galaxies. However, the X-ray luminosity of 82 objects cannot be explained by the collective emission of X-ray binaries, rendering them strong candidates for dwarf galaxies with an active accreting black hole in their centre.

      "abstract": "Understanding the occurrence and properties of actively accreting black holes, known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), is crucial for unraveling the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies across different mass scales. However, existing classification systems for identifying AGN based on optical emission-line diagnostics are primarily optimized for giant galaxies with stellar masses, M\u2217 &gt; 109.5 M\u2299. This poses a significant challenge in detecting AGN in low-metallicity and highly star-forming galaxies, particularly typical z\u223c0 dwarfs. In this work, we uncover AGN in dwarfs that have strong emission lines using a multi-diagnostic classification system that optimizes the use of existing optical diagnostics. Our multi-diagnostic system is more robust and systematic, providing a consistent categorization of galaxies that lack unique classifications. This systematic approach enables the identification of a hidden population of AGN candidates, referred to as Star Forming-AGN (SF-AGN), in metal-poor, gas-rich, star-forming dwarfs at z\u223c0. We apply this system to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys and discover that the percentage of optical AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines ranges from \u223c3-15%, which significantly exceeds previous estimates of \u223c1%.To investigate the frequency of actively accreting black holes in the nearby Universe, we compile a comprehensive inventory of AGN in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, using optical emission line diagnostics, including our multi-diagnostic approach for identifying SF-AGN, and mid-IR color-selection using WISE colors. The statistical completeness of the RESOLVE and ECO surveys allows us to calculate accurate AGN occupation fractions, representing the number of AGN relative to the total number of galaxies within the survey volume, including those that did not meet the criteria for any AGN search sample. Among the entire galaxy population, the percentage of optical and mid-IR AGN in dwarfs is approximately \u223c3-5%, whereas in giants it ranges from \u223c20-33%. Notably, the dwarf AGN percentage is at least double the previous estimates, while the AGN occurrence in giants is consistent with earlier studies. A key finding of this research is that AGN hosted by typical z\u223c0 dwarfs are predominantly classified as SF-AGN or WISE AGN.Subsequently, we extend the optical multi-diagnostic AGN classification system to a large archival dataset based on the SDSS footprint, encompassing 10\u00d7 the number of galaxies. Similar to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, we observe that over half of the dwarf AGN in the archival sample fall into the newly identified SFAGN category. Leveraging the statistical power of this archival dataset, we investigate the relationship between galaxy compactness and AGN activity as a function of mass. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between compactness and AGN percentage in a mass regime where galaxies are transitioning between dwarfs and giants.",

      "title": "Alternative diagnostic diagrams and the `forgotten' population of weak line galaxies in the SDSS",
      "abstract": "A numerous population of weak line galaxies (WLGs) is often left out of statistical studies on emission-line galaxies (ELGs) due to the absence of an adequate classification scheme, since classical diagnostic diagrams, such as [OIII]/H\u03b2 versus [NII]/H\u03b1 (the BPT diagram), require the measurement of at least four emission lines. This paper aims to remedy this situation by transposing the usual divisory lines between star-forming (SF) galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosts and between Seyferts and LINERs to diagrams that are more economical in terms of line quality requirements. By doing this, we rescue from the classification limbo a substantial number of sources and modify the global census of ELGs. More specifically, (1) we use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 to constitute a suitable sample of 280000 ELGs, one-third of which are WLGs. (2) Galaxies with strong emission lines are classified using the widely applied criteria of Kewley et al., Kauffmann et al. and Stasi\u0144ska et al. to distinguish SF galaxies and AGN hosts and Kewley et al. to distinguish Seyferts from LINERs. (3) We transpose these classification schemes to alternative diagrams keeping [NII]/H\u03b1 as a horizontal axis, but replacing H\u03b2 by a stronger line (H\u03b1 or [OII]), or substituting the ionization-level sensitive [OIII]/H\u03b2 ratio with the equivalent width of H\u03b1 (W<SUB>H\u03b1</SUB>). Optimized equations for the transposed divisory lines are provided. (4) We show that nothing significant is lost in the translation, but that the new diagrams allow one to classify up to 50 per cent more ELGs. (5) Introducing WLGs in the census of galaxies in the local Universe increases the proportion of metal-rich SF galaxies and especially LINERs. <P />In the course of this analysis, we were led to make the following points. (i) The Kewley et al. BPT line for galaxy classification is generally ill-used. (ii) Replacing [OIII]/H\u03b2 by W<SUB>H\u03b1</SUB> in the classification introduces a change in the philosophy of the distinction between LINERs and Seyferts, but not in its results. Because the W<SUB>H\u03b1</SUB> versus [NII]/H\u03b1 diagram can be applied to the largest sample of ELGs without loss of discriminating power between Seyferts and LINERs, we recommend its use in further studies. (iii) The dichotomy between Seyferts and LINERs is washed out by WLGs in the BPT plane, but it subsists in other diagnostic diagrams. This suggests that the right wing in the BPT diagram is indeed populated by at least two classes, tentatively identified with bona fide AGN and `retired' galaxies that have stopped forming stars and are ionized by their old stellar populations.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers the techniques to distinguish normal star-forming (NSF) galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) hosts using optical spectra. The observational data base is a set of 20000 galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, for which we have determined the emission-line intensities after subtracting the stellar continuum obtained from spectral synthesis. Our analysis is based on photoionization models computed using the stellar ionizing radiation predicted by population synthesis codes (essentially STARBURST99) and, for the AGNs, a broken power-law spectrum. We explain why, among the four classical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, ([OIII]/H\u03b2 versus [OII]/H\u03b2, [OIII]/H\u03b2 versus [NII]/H\u03b1 (the BPT diagram), [OIII]/H\u03b2 versus [SII]/H\u03b1 and [OIII]/H\u03b2 versus [OI]/H\u03b1), the BPT one works best. We show, however, that none of these diagrams is efficient in detecting AGNs in metal-poor galaxies, should such cases exist. We propose a new divisory line between `pure' NSF galaxies and AGN hosts: y = (-30.787 + 1.1358x + 0.27297x<SUP>2</SUP>) tanh (5.7409x) - 31.093, where y = log([OIII]/H\u03b2), and x = log([NII]/H\u03b1). According to our models, the divisory line drawn empirically by Kauffmann et al. includes among NSF galaxies objects that may have an AGN contribution to H\u03b2 of up to 3 per cent. The Kewley et al. line allows for an AGN contribution of roughly 20 per cent. About 20 per cent of the galaxies in our entire sample that can be represented in the BTP diagram are found between our divisory line and the Kauffmann et al. line, meaning that the local Universe contains a fair proportion of galaxies with a very low-level nuclear activity, in agreement with the statistics from observations of nuclei of nearby galaxies. We also show that a classification into NSF and AGN galaxies using only [NII]/H\u03b1 is feasible and useful. <P />Finally, we propose a new classification diagram, the DEW diagram, plotting D<SUB>n</SUB>(4000) versus max(EW[OII], EW[NeIII]). This diagram can be used with optical spectra for galaxies with redshifts up to z = 1.3, meaning an important progress over classifications proposed up to now. Since the DEW diagram requires only a small range in wavelength, it can also be used at even larger redshifts in suitable atmospheric windows. It also has the advantage of not requiring stellar synthesis analysis to subtract the stars and of allowing one to see all the galaxies in the same diagram, including passive galaxies.",

This leads to the question: do low-metallicity AGN exist? In this paper, we use photoionization models to examine the effects of metallicity variations on the narrow emission-lines from an AGN. We explore a variety of emission-line diagnostics that are useful for identifying AGN with low-metallicity gas. We find that line ratios involving [NII] are the most robust metallicity indicators in galaxies where the primary source of ionization is from the active nucleus. Ratios involving [SII] and [OI] are strongly affected by uncertainties in modelling the density structure of the narrow-line clouds. To test our diagnostics, we turn to an analysis of AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a clear trend in the relative strength of [NII] with the mass of the AGN-host galaxy. The metallicity of the ISM is known to be correlated with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies; our results indicate that a similar trend exists for AGN. We also find that the best-fitting models for typical Seyfert narrow-line regions (NLRs) have supersolar abundances. Although there is a mass-dependent range of a factor of 2-3 in the NLR metallicities of the AGN in our sample, AGN with subsolar metallicities are very rare in the SDSS.

      "abstract": "Dwarf AGN serve as the ideal systems for identifying intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) down to the most elusive regimes ($\\sim 10^3 - 10^4 M_{\\odot}$). However, the ubiquitously metal-poor nature of dwarf galaxies gives rise to ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that can mimic the spectral signatures of IMBH excitation. We present a novel photoionization model suite that simultaneously incorporates IMBHs and ULXs in a metal-poor, highly star-forming environment. We account for changes in $M_{BH}$ according to formation seeding channels and metallicity, and changes in ULX populations with post-starburst age and metallicity. We find that broadband X-rays and UV emission lines are insensitive to $M_{BH}$ and largely unable to distinguish between ULXs and IMBHs. Many optical diagnostic diagrams cannot correctly identify dwarf AGN. The notable exceptions include He~II~$\u03bb$4686 and [O~I]~$\u03bb$6300, for which we redefine typical demarcations to account for ULX contributions. Emission lines in the mid-IR show the most promise in separating stellar, ULX, IMBH, and shock excitation while presenting sensitivity to $M_{BH}$ and $f_{\\text{AGN}}$. Overall, our results expose the potential biases in identifying and characterizing dwarf AGN purely on strong line ratios and diagnostic diagrams rather than holistically evaluating the entire spectrum. As a proof of concept, we argue that recently discovered over-massive BHs in high-$z$ JWST AGN might not represent the overall BH population, with many galaxies in these samples potentially being falsely classified as purely star-forming.",
