      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it directly addresses the main paper's topic of finding low-metallicity dwarf AGN candidates using optimized emission-line diagnostics. It uses the same RESOLVE and ECO surveys and presents a modified classification scheme, including the identification of 'star-forming AGN' (SF-AGN)."
    },
    "2": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is highly relevant because it builds upon the methodology described in the main paper, focusing on the RESOLVE and ECO surveys to provide a multiwavelength census of dwarf AGN, including the SF-AGN category. It also uses BPT diagrams and explores the frequency of AGN in dwarf galaxies."
    },
    "3": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant as it focuses on finding AGN in dwarf galaxies using spatially-resolved spectroscopy and emission-line diagnostic diagrams. It identifies a sample of AGN dwarf galaxies and SF-AGNs, which aligns with the main paper's goal. However, it doesn't specifically address the RESOLVE survey or low-metallicity AGN to the same extent as other results."
    },
    "4": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it focuses on X-ray activity in dwarf galaxies and identifies candidates for dwarf galaxies with active accreting black holes. It also touches on the fraction of AGN among dwarf galaxies. However, it does not use the SF-AGN classification scheme described in the main paper and relies on X-ray data rather than optical emission line diagnostics as the primary method."
    },
    "5": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it directly addresses the main paper's topic, focusing on investigating AGN in dwarf and giant galaxies using a multi-diagnostic classification system, including the identification of SF-AGN. It applies this system to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys and discusses the percentage of AGN in dwarfs."
    },
    "6": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant because it discusses alternative diagnostic diagrams for classifying galaxies, including AGN hosts. While it mentions BPT diagrams, it focuses on weak-line galaxies and transposing classification schemes, which is tangential to the main paper's focus on dwarf AGN and the SF-AGN classification."
    },
    "7": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it discusses the search for AGN signatures in line-emitting galaxies, including dwarf galaxies, using the BPT emission-line ratio diagnostic diagram. While it doesn't mention the SF-AGN classification specifically, it addresses the topic of identifying AGN in dwarf galaxies and provides statistics on the AGN fraction."
    },
    "8": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant because it discusses techniques to distinguish AGN hosts using optical spectra and proposes a new divisory line between star-forming galaxies and AGN hosts. However, it does not specifically focus on dwarf galaxies or the SF-AGN classification scheme, making it less directly relevant to the main paper."
    },
    "9": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant because it focuses on emission-line diagnostics of low-metallicity AGN and explores the effects of metallicity variations on the narrow emission lines from an AGN. It also discusses the use of [NII], [SII], and [OI] as metallicity indicators, which connects to the main paper's methodology. However, it doesn't specifically address dwarf galaxies or the RESOLVE survey."
    },
    "10": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant because it discusses emission line diagnostics for IMBHs in dwarf galaxies, but it emphasizes the importance of accounting for BH seeding and ULX excitation, which is a different approach. Also, it is critical of diagnostic diagrams. While it addresses dwarf galaxies and AGN, its focus and conclusions differ significantly from the main paper."

      "Future research could focus on directly comparing the results obtained using different classification schemes and datasets to assess the consistency of the findings.",
      "More studies could investigate the physical properties of SF-AGN and their relationship to the host dwarf galaxies.",
      "Further work could be done to refine the emission-line diagnostics specifically for low-metallicity dwarf AGN, accounting for the potential contamination from other sources such as ULXs."
