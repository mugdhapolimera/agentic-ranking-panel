        "2": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is also highly relevant as it is a follow-up study to the main paper, providing a multiwavelength census of dwarf AGN candidates in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys using the methodology outlined in the main paper."},
        "3": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant as it discusses a new sample of AGN dwarf galaxies identified using spatially-resolved spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey. However, it does not directly use the same methodology as the main paper."},
        "4": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant as it discusses X-ray active dwarf galaxies identified using SRG/eROSITA data, which could potentially be AGN candidates. However, it does not use the same optical emission-line diagnostics as the main paper."},

        "8": {"score": 1, "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant as it discusses techniques for distinguishing AGN hosts from star-forming galaxies using emission-line diagnostics. However, it does not specifically focus on low-metallicity dwarf galaxies."},
        "9": {"score": 1, "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant as it discusses emission-line diagnostics for identifying low-metallicity AGN. However, it does not specifically focus on dwarf galaxies or the RESOLVE survey."},
