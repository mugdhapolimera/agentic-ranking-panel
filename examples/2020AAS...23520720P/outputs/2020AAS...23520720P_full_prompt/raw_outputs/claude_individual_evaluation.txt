        "3": {"score": 3, "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it investigates active galactic nuclei in dwarf and giant galaxies in the nearby universe, using the same multi-diagnostic emission line classification scheme as the main paper to identify AGN candidates in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys."},
        "4": {"score": 2, "explanation": "This result is relevant as it discusses using Bayesian inference to model AGN/star formation mixing fractions in galaxies from the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, which is related to the main paper's goal of identifying AGN in dwarf galaxies."},
