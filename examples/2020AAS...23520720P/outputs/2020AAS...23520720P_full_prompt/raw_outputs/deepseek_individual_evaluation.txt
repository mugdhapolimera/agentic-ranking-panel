    "individual_scores": {
        "1": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "This result directly compares the main paper's multi-diagnostic method with other AGN detection techniques (mid-IR, redefined BPT) in the same surveys (RESOLVE/ECO). It validates the main paper's conclusion that the comprehensive emission-line method identifies more dwarf AGN (including SF-AGN) and discusses their properties, aligning closely with the main paper's goals and methodology."
        },
        "2": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "This result is highly aligned with the main paper, as it focuses on the same surveys (RESOLVE/ECO) and introduces the SF-AGN category. It corroborates the main paper's findings by confirming the prevalence of SF-AGN in low-metallicity dwarfs and quantifying their contribution to the AGN population, directly supporting the main paper's methodology and conclusions."
        },
        "3": {
            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "This result extends the main paper's multi-diagnostic approach to a larger archival dataset, reinforcing the discovery of SF-AGN in dwarfs. It also investigates AGN-galaxy coevolution trends (e.g., compactness vs. AGN activity), which complements the main paper's focus on refining AGN detection in low-mass systems."
        },
        "4": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "While relevant to AGN detection in RESOLVE/ECO, this result uses Bayesian inference to model AGN/star formation mixing fractions, diverging methodologically from the main paper's emission-line diagnostics. However, it addresses ambiguities in traditional classifications, which is a related challenge discussed in the main paper."
        },
        "5": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "This result investigates AGN in the RESOLVE survey but uses emission-line profile fitting (e.g., broad wings) instead of the main paper's multi-diagnostic line ratios. The focus on low-metallicity AGN overlaps with the main paper, but the methodological differences reduce alignment."
        },
        "6": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "This result provides theoretical support for the main paper's approach by modeling low-metallicity AGN emission-line diagnostics. However, it focuses on general AGN metallicity trends rather than the RESOLVE survey or SF-AGN, making it supplementary but not directly tied to the main paper's specific results."
        },
        "7": {
            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "This result presents a new AGN identification method based on emission-line excess, which is tangentially related but methodologically distinct from the main paper's multi-diagnostic scheme. It does not specifically address low-metallicity dwarfs or RESOLVE/ECO data, reducing relevance."
        },
        "8": {
            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "This result studies dwarf AGN environments using SDSS data, a tangential focus compared to the main paper's emission-line classification. While it acknowledges AGN in dwarfs, it does not address metallicity biases or SF-AGN, making it only peripherally relevant."
        },
        "9": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "This result identifies low-metallicity AGN via broad-line emission, a different technique from the main paper's narrow-line diagnostics. However, the focus on low-metallicity dwarfs and the challenge of detecting AGN in such systems aligns with the main paper's broader goals."
        }
    },
    "overall_analysis": {
        "strengths": [
            "Multiple results (1, 2, 3) directly validate and extend the main paper's methodology using RESOLVE/ECO data.",
            "Results 1 and 2 provide critical multi-method comparisons, reinforcing the main paper's conclusions about SF-AGN prevalence.",
            "Result 3 offers scalability to larger datasets, enhancing the main paper's impact."
        ],
        "weaknesses": [
            "Some results (4, 5, 6, 9) explore related but methodologically distinct approaches, reducing direct relevance.",
            "Results 7 and 8 focus on tangential aspects (e.g., environments, general AGN demographics) rather than the main paper's core innovation (SF-AGN classification)."
        ],
        "suggestions": [
            "Include multi-wavelength confirmation (e.g., X-ray, radio) for SF-AGN candidates to strengthen claims, as hinted in the main paper.",
            "Compare the Bayesian mixing-fraction method (Result 4) with the main paper's classification scheme to assess consistency.",
            "Investigate whether broad-line AGN (Result 9) overlap with SF-AGN candidates to explore complementary detection methods."
