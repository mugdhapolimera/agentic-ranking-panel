      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is highly relevant. It directly compares methods of finding dwarf AGN at similar redshifts (z~0) using the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, which are key elements from the main paper. It also discusses the multi-diagnostic approach for identifying Star Forming-AGN (SF-AGN), a central point of the main paper."
    },
    "2": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is highly relevant. It provides a multiwavelength census of dwarf AGN in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, explicitly mentioning the multi-diagnostic approach and the identification of SF-AGN. It also uses the BPT diagram and mid-IR colors, as suggested in the main paper for follow-up studies."
    },
    "3": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is highly relevant because it discusses the identification of AGN in dwarf galaxies using a multi-diagnostic classification system. It uses RESOLVE and ECO surveys, identifies SF-AGN, and investigates the frequency of actively accreting black holes, all of which align closely with the main paper's objectives and methodology."
    },
    "4": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant. It applies a Bayesian classification scheme to predict the AGN vs. star formation emission in RESOLVE and ECO galaxies. While it doesn't focus specifically on SF-AGN, it addresses the issue of mixed cases and uses all available optical spectroscopy, which is aligned with the general goals of the main paper. The use of Bayesian inference is a different methodology, but still relevant to understanding AGN emission processes in these galaxies."
    },
    "5": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant. It discusses efforts to identify low-metallicity AGN in the RESOLVE survey, acknowledging that they may not separate from star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram. It proposes using emission-line profile fitting, a different methodology than the main paper, but aimed at the same problem. It's less directly aligned with the SF-AGN aspect but still addresses the core issue of finding low-metallicity AGN."
    },
    "6": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant. It discusses emission-line diagnostics of low-metallicity AGN and explores various emission-line ratios. However, it focuses on a general analysis using photoionization models and the SDSS, rather than specifically targeting dwarf galaxies or using the RESOLVE survey. The connection to the main paper is weaker, as it doesn't address the SF-AGN category or the specific methodology of the main paper."
    },
    "7": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant. It presents a new method for identifying AGN based on emission-line excess and compares it with the BPT diagram. While it touches on AGN identification, it doesn't focus on dwarf galaxies, low metallicity, or the specific RESOLVE survey used in the main paper. The relevance is limited to the general topic of AGN identification methods."
    },
    "8": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant. It explores the environments of dwarf galaxies with optical AGN characteristics, using the NASA-Sloan Atlas. While it focuses on dwarf galaxies and AGN, it doesn't address the specific SF-AGN category or the RESOLVE survey. The relevance lies in the study of AGN in dwarf galaxies but lacks methodological alignment with the main paper."
    },
    "9": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant as it reports the discovery of low-metallicity dwarf galaxies with broad line emission, suggesting the presence of AGN. While it concerns low-metallicity AGN in dwarf galaxies, it uses data from SDSS and doesn't directly use or refer to the specific methodology or surveys (RESOLVE, ECO) mentioned in the main paper. Therefore, the relevance is limited to the topic of low-metallicity AGN in dwarf galaxies."

    "strengths": [
      "Several results directly address the main paper's topic of finding low-metallicity dwarf AGN.",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Some results are only tangentially relevant, focusing on general AGN properties or different datasets without specifically addressing the core research questions of the main paper.",
      "There is some redundancy in the focus, with multiple results reiterating the same findings or using similar methodologies without significantly advancing the research.",
      "Some results use different methodologies (e.g., Bayesian inference, emission-line profile fitting) which, while relevant, do not directly build upon the main paper's specific approach."

    "suggestions": [
      "Future research should focus on further validating the SF-AGN classification using multiwavelength data (X-ray, mid-IR, radio) and spatially resolved spectroscopy, as suggested in the main paper.",
      "Explore the physical properties and environments of SF-AGN in more detail to understand the conditions that favor their formation.",
      "Compare and contrast the SF-AGN identified using different methods (e.g., optical emission lines, mid-IR colors) to understand the biases and limitations of each approach.",
      "Investigate the impact of SF-AGN on galaxy evolution, including their role in star formation feedback and chemical enrichment."
