    "3": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it investigates active galactic nuclei in dwarf and giant galaxies in the nearby universe, using the same multi-diagnostic emission line classification scheme as the main paper to identify AGN candidates in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys."

    "4": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant as it discusses using Bayesian inference to model AGN/star formation mixing fractions in galaxies from the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, which is related to the main paper's goal of identifying AGN in dwarf galaxies."

      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is relevant as it discusses efforts to detect low-metallicity AGN in the RESOLVE survey, which is the main focus of the main paper."

      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant as it explores the environments of dwarf galaxies with optical AGN characteristics, but it does not directly relate to the main paper's methodology or the RESOLVE and ECO surveys."

      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result is somewhat relevant as it discusses the discovery of low-metallicity AGN in dwarf galaxies, which is related to the main paper's topic, but it does not appear to be directly related to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys or the specific methodology used in the main paper."
