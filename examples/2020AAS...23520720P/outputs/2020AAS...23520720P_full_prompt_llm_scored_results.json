  "title": "Finding Low-Metallicity Dwarf AGN Candidates at z 0 using the RESOLVE Survey",
  "abstract": "We present a modified emission line classification scheme to categorize galaxies as definite star forming, composite, AGN, or star-forming AGN (SF-AGN). This scheme uses a combination of the [NII]/H-alpha (BPT), [SII]/H-alpha, and [OI]/H-alpha emission line diagnostic plots. SF-AGN is a new category of AGN candidates that were previously classified inconsistently among the three diagnostics. Our new scheme aims to identify undetected AGN candidates among dwarf galaxies, determining a better lower limit for the z~0 massive black hole occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies. We use photoionization models to show that the [SII] and [OI] line diagnostics identify AGN in low metallicity dwarf galaxies that are missed by the BPT diagnostic, providing theoretical motivation for using our new scheme. We apply this scheme to galaxies in the z~0 RESOLVE survey, a statistically complete volume-limited census dominated by dwarfs (stellar mass &lt; 10<SUP>9.5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>). For initial classification, we use SDSS MPA-JHU line measurements with S/N &gt; 5 for all relevant emission lines. This S/N cut limits the ~1500 galaxy RESOLVE survey to a sample of 462 galaxies, of which 306 are dwarfs. Including SF-AGN, we find that 5.2% of dwarfs are AGN candidates, compared to 0.3% using the traditional AGN/composite classifications alone. The SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs having moderately high long-term star formation, but not necessarily recent starburst activity. We seek external confirmation of these results by comparisons to archival X-ray, mid-IR, and radio data. We also examine spatially resolved spectroscopy available from the RESOLVE and SAMI surveys for a subset of the candidates to check that AGN signatures appear only near the center of the galaxy. This work sets the stage for follow-up studies of dwarf AGN black hole occupancy, outflows, and mixing fractions of star formation and AGN activity.",

      "title": "Comparing Methods of Finding z 0 Dwarf AGN using the RESOLVE and ECO Surveys",
      "abstract": "Finding AGN in metal-poor, gas-rich, star-forming dwarfs is an ongoing challenge, with complementary detection methods sensitive to different dwarf AGN subpopulations. In this study, we compare the statistics and properties of z~0 dwarf AGN in the volume- and mass-limited RESOLVE and ECO surveys found by three methods: (1) comprehensive optical emission-line classification simultaneously using the [O III]/Hb vs. [N II]/Ha (BPT plot), [S II]/Ha, and [O I]/Ha diagnostic plots, (2) a redefined demarcation line for the BPT plot, and (3) mid-IR colour selection. The comprehensive emission-line method finds a new category of AGN in metal-poor, gas-rich, and star-forming dwarfs, contributing to a ~3-15x higher dwarf AGN percentage than previously identified with strong emission lines (Polimera et al., 2022). Each of the three methods identifies AGN in ~1-2% of dwarfs in the full galaxy population. AGN hosts identified by the comprehensive classification method vs. by mid-IR colours appear similar \u2014 mostly dwarfs with high star formation activity, high gas content, and low metallicity \u2014 but there is virtually no overlap in the identified objects. Relatively few AGN hosts identified by the redefined BPT plot are dwarfs, and these few dwarfs differ from those identified by the comprehensive classification method or mid-IR colours in having modest star formation activity, low gas content, and high metallicity. All methods together yield a full-population dwarf AGN percentage of ~3-5%, which falls in the middle of the range of dwarf AGN occupation fractions predicted by current AGN simulations.",

      "abstract": "We provide a multiwavelength census of dwarf Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the volume- and mass-limited RESOLVE and ECO surveys using mid-IR colours, the BPT diagnostic plot with both traditional and alternative demarcations from literature, and our new multi-diagnostic approach revealing the previously overlooked \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN). Emission line flux ratios of SF-AGN position them as star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram but as AGN in at least one of two other diagnostic plots using [OI]/H\u03b1 or [SII]/H\u03b1 instead of the metallicity-sensitive [NII]/H\u03b1 used in the BPT diagram. SF-AGN are common in local dwarf galaxies, and photoionization models confirm their line ratio patterns match those of model low-metallicity, highly star-forming dwarf galaxies with active intermediate-mass black holes. Given the statistically complete nature of these surveys down to baryonic (stellar+gas) masses of ~10<SUP>9.2</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>, they give us the opportunity to quote full-population AGN statistics previously unavailable in the dwarf regime. The addition of SF-AGN and bonus AGN from the alternative BPT plot quadruples the optical dwarf AGN percentage from ~1% to ~4% of the full galaxy population (including non-emission line galaxies). Mid-IR colours also identify up to ~4% of all dwarfs as AGN, albeit the status of the mid-IR AGN candidates is less secure than the optical AGN. We find little overlap between methods, hinting at the possibility that they identify AGN hosts at different evolutionary stages. The bonus dwarf AGN from the alternative BPT method mostly have relatively high metallicity and low star formation activity for dwarfs. In contrast, the mid-IR and SF-AGN hosts have more typical metallicities and star formation rates. Assuming all AGN candidates to be valid, the combined multiwavelength z~0 dwarf AGN frequency is ~5-8%, implying that active accretion onto intermediate mass BHs in dwarf galaxies may be more widespread than previously realised, with implications for BH-galaxy coevolution. We further investigate the properties and environments of SF-AGN and their hosts.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the occurrence and properties of actively accreting black holes, known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), is crucial for unraveling the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies across different mass scales. However, existing classification systems for identifying AGN based on optical emission-line diagnostics are primarily optimized for giant galaxies with stellar masses, M\u2217 &gt; 109.5 M\u2299. This poses a significant challenge in detecting AGN in low-metallicity and highly star-forming galaxies, particularly typical z\u223c0 dwarfs. In this work, we uncover AGN in dwarfs that have strong emission lines using a multi-diagnostic classification system that optimizes the use of existing optical diagnostics. Our multi-diagnostic system is more robust and systematic, providing a consistent categorization of galaxies that lack unique classifications. This systematic approach enables the identification of a hidden population of AGN candidates, referred to as Star Forming-AGN (SF-AGN), in metal-poor, gas-rich, star-forming dwarfs at z\u223c0. We apply this system to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys and discover that the percentage of optical AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines ranges from \u223c3-15%, which significantly exceeds previous estimates of \u223c1%.To investigate the frequency of actively accreting black holes in the nearby Universe, we compile a comprehensive inventory of AGN in the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, using optical emission line diagnostics, including our multi-diagnostic approach for identifying SF-AGN, and mid-IR color-selection using WISE colors. The statistical completeness of the RESOLVE and ECO surveys allows us to calculate accurate AGN occupation fractions, representing the number of AGN relative to the total number of galaxies within the survey volume, including those that did not meet the criteria for any AGN search sample. Among the entire galaxy population, the percentage of optical and mid-IR AGN in dwarfs is approximately \u223c3-5%, whereas in giants it ranges from \u223c20-33%. Notably, the dwarf AGN percentage is at least double the previous estimates, while the AGN occurrence in giants is consistent with earlier studies. A key finding of this research is that AGN hosted by typical z\u223c0 dwarfs are predominantly classified as SF-AGN or WISE AGN.Subsequently, we extend the optical multi-diagnostic AGN classification system to a large archival dataset based on the SDSS footprint, encompassing 10\u00d7 the number of galaxies. Similar to the RESOLVE and ECO surveys, we observe that over half of the dwarf AGN in the archival sample fall into the newly identified SFAGN category. Leveraging the statistical power of this archival dataset, we investigate the relationship between galaxy compactness and AGN activity as a function of mass. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between compactness and AGN percentage in a mass regime where galaxies are transitioning between dwarfs and giants.",

Diagnostic plot classification using BPT diagrams with Strong Emission Lines (SELs) leaves some galaxies ambiguously classified as AGN or Star Forming, suggesting the potential importance of mixed cases. Furthermore, the recently introduced diagnostic plot of [HeII/H-beta] vs. [NII/H-alpha] reveals additional AGN that are missed by a binary BPT classification. These observations motivate the need to use all available spectroscopic information simultaneously in a single Bayesian modeling framework. We also use new grids that self-consistently model different mixing fractions of AGN + Star Formation emission, correctly treating the combined radiation field, unlike older grids that have linearly combined pure AGN and pure Star Forming models to approximate mixed cases. This Bayesian classification gives insight into emission processes for galaxies that are ambiguously and inconsistently classified using traditional diagnostic plots by providing a single multi-dimensional posterior distribution for the AGN - Star Formation mixing fraction based on all available lines. We find that this approach is especially important for the low metallicity dwarfs that dominate our volume-limited local universe surveys.",

      "abstract": "Current emission-line-based estimates of the metallicity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at both high and low redshifts indicate that AGN have predominantly solar-to-supersolar metallicities. This leads to the question: do low-metallicity AGN exist? In this paper, we use photoionization models to examine the effects of metallicity variations on the narrow emission-lines from an AGN. We explore a variety of emission-line diagnostics that are useful for identifying AGN with low-metallicity gas. We find that line ratios involving [NII] are the most robust metallicity indicators in galaxies where the primary source of ionization is from the active nucleus. Ratios involving [SII] and [OI] are strongly affected by uncertainties in modelling the density structure of the narrow-line clouds. To test our diagnostics, we turn to an analysis of AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a clear trend in the relative strength of [NII] with the mass of the AGN-host galaxy. The metallicity of the ISM is known to be correlated with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies; our results indicate that a similar trend exists for AGN. We also find that the best-fitting models for typical Seyfert narrow-line regions (NLRs) have supersolar abundances. Although there is a mass-dependent range of a factor of 2-3 in the NLR metallicities of the AGN in our sample, AGN with subsolar metallicities are very rare in the SDSS. Out of a sample of ~23000 Seyfert 2 galaxies, we find only ~40 clear candidates for AGN with NLR abundances that are below solar.",

      "abstract": "We developed a new technique for identifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and studied the nature of low-luminosity AGNs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This is the former part of a series of papers. We develop a new, sensitive method of identifying AGNs in this paper. The emission-line luminosity in a spectrum is the sum of a star-formation component and an AGN component (if present). We demonstrate that an accurate estimate of the star-formation component can be achieved by fitting model spectra, generated with a recent stellar population synthesis code, to a continuum spectrum. By comparing the observed total line luminosity with that attributed to star formation, we can tell whether a galaxy hosts an AGN or not. We compare our method with the commonly used emission-line diagnostics proposed by Baldwin, Phillips, and Terlevich (1981, PASP, 93, 5; hereafter BPT). By this method, we classify 85% of the strong emission-line objects in the same star-formation/AGN as BPT. One unique feature of our method is its sensitivity; it is applicable to nearly twice as many objects as BPT. We further make a comparison between our method and the BPT diagnostics using stacked spectra and selections in X-ray and radio wavelengths. We show that it is overall a sensitive method of identifying AGNs, while our method suffers from incompleteness and contamination as any AGN identification method does so. We emphasize that our method can be applied at high redshifts (up to Z \u223c 1.7 with red-sensitive optical spectrograph) without making any a priori assumptions about the host-galaxy properties. Another unique feature is that it allows us to subtract the emission-line luminosity due to star formation, and to extract the intrinsic AGN luminosity.",

Regardless of selection method, this study finds no discernible differences in environment between AGN and non-AGN host dwarf galaxies and these results indicate that environment is not an important factor in triggering AGN activity in dwarf galaxies. This is in line with existing literature on environments of regular galaxies with AGNs and suggests universality in terms of reaction to environment across the mass regime. The biases of AGN selection in low-mass galaxies, and the biases of different measures of environment are also considered. It is found that there are several mass trends in emission-line ratios and that the SDSS fibre covers galaxies non-uniformly with redshift. These biases should be accounted for in future work by possibly including other wavelength regimes or mass weighting of emission-line ratios.

This is the case since AGN are usually found in massive, bulge-dominated galaxies that have converted most of their gas into stars by the present epoch. Since AGN metallicity is strongly correlated with stellar mass, low-metallicity AGN are expected to be in low-mass dwarf galaxies. However, until now, searches in low-mass galaxies have only turned up AGN with metallicities around half that of typical AGN, i.e. with solar or slightly subsolar values.

In the course of a long-range program to search for extremely metal-deficient emission-line dwarf galaxies, we have come across four galaxies with very unusual spectra: the strong permitted emission lines, mainly the H\u03b1 line, show very prominent broad components, with full widths at zero intensity corresponding to velocities varying between 2200 and 3500 km s<SUP>\u22121</SUP>, and extraordinarily large broad H\u03b1 luminosities, varying from 3\u00d710<SUP>41</SUP> to 2\u00d710<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>\u22121</SUP>.
