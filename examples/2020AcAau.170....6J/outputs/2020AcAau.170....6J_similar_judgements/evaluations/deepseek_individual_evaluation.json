      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "OCEANUS is another New Frontiers-class Uranus orbiter concept with similar objectives (interior structure, magnetosphere) and emphasis on low-cost instrumentation. Closely aligned with the main paper's focus."

    "3": {
      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "A software tool for visualizing magnetospheres. Not a mission concept and unrelated to the technical or scientific goals of the main paper."

    "4": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Focuses on optimizing a Flagship mission tour design. While related to Uranus exploration, it addresses a different mission class (Flagship vs. New Frontiers) and lacks direct alignment with QUEST's methodology."
    },
    "5": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Broad study of ice giant mission priorities, including Decadal Survey context. Supports the need for Uranus exploration but lacks focus on New Frontiers-class feasibility."
    },
    "6": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Focuses on atmospheric probes, not orbiters. Tangentially related to ice giant science but diverges from the main paper's orbiter-centric methodology."
    },
    "7": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "Another New Frontiers Uranus orbiter concept with nearly identical science goals (magnetosphere, interior, satellites) and design considerations. Highly relevant and methodologically aligned."
    },
    "8": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Proposes a Flagship-class multi-planet mission (Saturn + Uranus). Different scope, cost, and objectives compared to the focused New Frontiers approach of the main paper."

    "9": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Theoretical study of ice giant magnetospheres. Relevant to the science goals of QUEST but does not address mission design or feasibility."

    "10": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Advocates for a Flagship mission, which differs from the New Frontiers focus of the main paper. Supports Uranus exploration broadly but diverges in mission class."
    },
    "11": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "Directly parallels the main paper's case for a New Frontiers Uranus orbiter, emphasizing cross-disciplinary science and mission feasibility. Closely aligned in goals and methodology."
    },
    "12": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "Argues for an orbiter + probe mission. Shares science goals with QUEST but introduces a probe component absent in the main paper, reducing methodological alignment."
    },
    "13": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "ESA-focused study advocating ice giant exploration. Relevant to broader objectives but lacks specificity on New Frontiers-class missions or QUEST's design."
    },
    "14": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "Heliophysics-focused mission with different primary objectives (magnetospheric physics vs. system science). Limited overlap with QUEST's interdisciplinary goals."

  "overall_analysis": {
    "strengths": [
      "Multiple results (1, 2, 7, 11) directly address New Frontiers-class Uranus orbiter concepts, aligning closely with the main paper's objectives.",
      "Several studies (5, 9, 12, 13) provide broader context for ice giant exploration, reinforcing the scientific importance of Uranus missions.",
      "Results 7 and 11 offer detailed technical and scientific parallels to QUEST, validating the feasibility of the mission concept."

    "weaknesses": [
      "Some results (3, 8, 17, 20) are unrelated to Uranus orbiter missions or focus on different targets/methodologies.",
      "Flagship-class mission proposals (4, 8, 10, 19) dilute relevance to the New Frontiers focus.",
      "Atmospheric probe studies (6, 18) diverge from the main paper's orbiter-centric approach."

      "Filter results by mission class (New Frontiers) to exclude Flagship proposals.",
      "Prioritize studies with explicit technical design analysis for Uranus orbiters.",
      "Exclude purely observational/theoretical studies unrelated to mission feasibility."
