            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "Advocates for a Flagship mission, which differs from the New Frontiers focus of the main paper. Supports Uranus exploration broadly but diverges in mission class."

            "score": 3,
            "explanation": "Directly parallels the main paper's case for a New Frontiers Uranus orbiter, emphasizing cross-disciplinary science and mission feasibility. Closely aligned in goals and methodology."

            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "Argues for an orbiter + probe mission. Shares science goals with QUEST but introduces a probe component absent in the main paper, reducing methodological alignment."

        "13": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "ESA-focused study advocating ice giant exploration. Relevant to broader objectives but lacks specificity on New Frontiers-class missions or QUEST's design."

            "score": 1,
            "explanation": "Heliophysics-focused mission with different primary objectives (magnetospheric physics vs. system science). Limited overlap with QUEST's interdisciplinary goals."

        "15": {
            "score": 2,
            "explanation": "ESA M-class mission concept. Shares science themes but differs in mission class and international partnership scope compared to the NASA-centric New Frontiers approach."

        "weaknesses": [
            "Some results (3, 8, 17, 20) are unrelated to Uranus orbiter missions or focus on different targets/methodologies.",
