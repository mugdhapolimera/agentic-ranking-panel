      "abstract": "Ice-giant-sized planets are the most common type of observed exoplanet, yet the two ice giants in our own solar system (Uranus and Neptune) are the least explored class of planet, having only been observed through ground-based observations and a single flyby each by Voyager 2 approximately 30 years ago. These single flybys were unable to characterize the spatial and temporal variability in ice giant magnetospheres, some of the most odd and intriguing magnetospheres in the solar system. They also offered only limited constraints on the internal structure of ice giants; understanding the internal structure of a planet is important for understanding its formation and evolution. The most recent planetary science Decadal Survey by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, \"Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022,\" identified the ice giant Uranus as the third highest priority for a Flagship mission in the decade 2013-2022. However, in the event that NASA or another space agency is unable to fly a Flagship-class mission to an ice giant in the next decade, this paper presents a mission concept for a focused, lower cost Uranus orbiter called OCEANUS (Origins and Composition of the Exoplanet Analog Uranus System). OCEANUS would increase our understanding of the interior structure of Uranus, its magnetosphere, and how its magnetic field is generated. These goals could be achieved with just a magnetometer and the spacecraft's radio system. This study shows that several of the objectives outlined by the Decadal Survey, including one of the two identified as highest priority, are within reach for a New-Frontiers-class mission.",

This mission enables broad, cross-disciplinary science of an ice giant system, including the planet, moons, rings, and magnetosphere. The ice giants represent a size class of planet that is largely unexplored but that is common among extrasolar planet systems. At the same time, Uranus is unique, possessing a regular satellite system, rings, and a complex magnetosphere surrounding a planet tilted over for extreme seasonal variation. Exploration of the Uranian system is guided by a broad suite of science Objectives and through remote sensing, in situ probe, and fields and particles experiments. Due to the rapid nature of the Decadal concept study, the orbital tour could not be perfectly optimized, but a best effort was made to include orbit insertion, probe release and relay, and multiple satellite flybys; some Objectives were necessarily better met than others by this tour. The mission's tour trajectory can be optimized to meet any of the Decadal Science Objectives, by focusing on a particular system target, for example magnetosphere, satellites, or planet interior, but the best tour will simultaneously meet the highest priority measurements for every Objective. The community-led (with no institutional or NASA sponsorship) poll described here was designed to collect broad science inputs on the tour parameters required for each Decadal Science Objective. Here we present results aggregated by Objective, as well as compared longitudinally, of the highest priority tour needs identified across all Objectives. Both the raw and aggregated data are made publicly available for future white papers, tour and trajectory work, as well as mission and instrument design teams, but the results are not binding nor decisional in any way.",

Most of our detailed information about them comes from fleeting looks by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in the 1980s. Voyager, and ground-based work since then, found that these planets, their satellites, rings, and magnetospheres, challenge our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We also now know that Uranus-Neptune size planets are common around other stars. These are some of the reasons ice giant exploration was a high priority in NASA's most recent Planetary Science Decadal Survey. In preparation for the next Decadal Survey, NASA, with ESA participation, conducted a broad study of possible ice giant missions in the 2024-2037 timeframe. This paper summarizes the key results of the study, and addresses questions that have been raised by the science community and in a recent NASA review. Foremost amongst these are questions about the science objectives, the science payload, and the importance of an atmospheric probe. The conclusions of the NASA/ESA study remain valid. In particular, it is a high priority to send an orbiter and atmospheric probe to at least one of the ice giants, with instrumentation to study all components of an ice giant system. Uranus and Neptune are found to be equally compelling as science targets. The two planets are not equivalent, however, and each system has things to teach us the other cannot. An additional mission study is needed to refine plans for future exploration of these worlds.",

      "abstract": "The ice giants Uranus and Neptune are the least understood class of planets in our solar system but the most frequently observed type of exoplanets. Presumed to have a small rocky core, a deep interior comprising \u223c70% heavy elements surrounded by a more dilute outer envelope of H<SUB>2</SUB> and He, Uranus and Neptune are fundamentally different from the better-explored gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Because of the lack of dedicated exploration missions, our knowledge of the composition and atmospheric processes of these distant worlds is primarily derived from remote sensing from Earth-based observatories and space telescopes. As a result, Uranus's and Neptune's physical and atmospheric properties remain poorly constrained and their roles in the evolution of the Solar System not well understood. Exploration of an ice giant system is therefore a high-priority science objective as these systems (including the magnetosphere, satellites, rings, atmosphere, and interior) challenge our understanding of planetary formation and evolution. Here we describe the main scientific goals to be addressed by a future in situ exploration of an ice giant. An atmospheric entry probe targeting the 10-bar level, about 5 scale heights beneath the tropopause, would yield insight into two broad themes: i) the formation history of the ice giants and, in a broader extent, that of the Solar System, and ii) the processes at play in planetary atmospheres. The probe would descend under parachute to measure composition, structure, and dynamics, with data returned to Earth using a Carrier Relay Spacecraft as a relay station. In addition, possible mission concepts and partnerships are presented, and a strawman ice-giant probe payload is described. An ice-giant atmospheric probe could represent a significant ESA contribution to a future NASA ice-giant flagship mission.",

      "title": "New Frontiers-class Uranus Orbiter: A Case For Exploring The Feasibility of Achieving Multidisciplinary Science With a Mid-scale Mission",
      "abstract": "Uranus presents a compelling scientific target and provides a unique opportunity to explore Ice Giant system science. The Ice Giants, Uranus and Neptune, represent a distinct class of planets with-in our solar system that has yet to be fully explored or understood. Characteristics of the Uranian system, in particular, include: 1) a dynamically full and haphazard ring-moon system; 2) five major satellites - potential ocean worlds with drastic surface features; 3) a dramatically configured magnetosphere with highly-tilted rotational and magnetic axes; 4) a bulk planetary com-position dominated by heavier \"ices\" such as H$ _{2}$O, CH$ _{4}$, and NH$ _{3}$; and 5) a unique wind pattern and unknown circulation structure. Detailed study of Uranus by an orbiter is crucial not only for valuable insights into the formation of our solar system but also for providing ground truths for the understanding of Ice Giant-sized exoplanets. As such, the imperative and timely exploration of Uranus will not only enhance our understanding of the Ice Giant planets but also extends to planetary dynamics throughout our solar system and beyond. The 2013 Planetary Science Decadal Survey Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022 (V\\&amp;V) states: \"The ice giants are thus one of the great remaining unknowns in the solar system, the only class of planet that has never been explored in detail\". It also recommended \"Uranus Orbiter and Probe\" as the third-highest priority \"large-class\" mission. Unfortunately, no Ice Giant mission will be implemented before 2022, which makes it unclear whether a mission would make the 2030-2034 launch window necessary to take advantage of a Jupiter gravity assist to reach the Uranian system before it reaches equinox in 2049; after this the northern hemispheres of the satellites not imaged by Voyager 2 will begin to recede back into darkness. The timeliness of a mission to Uranus is thus a primary motivation for evaluating what science can be done with a lower-cost, potentially faster-turnaround mission, such as a New Frontiers (NF)-class orbiter to Uranus. This presentation summarizes one of three such proposals submitted to the 2019 Planetary Sciences Pre-Decadal Mission Concept Study (PMCS) opportunity. V\\&amp;V recommended in-situ measurements of noble gases and elemental isotopic ratios crucial for understanding the origin and evolution of Ice Giant planets. However, this paper presents the scientific basis for a mission which omits science objectives only achievable via in-situ measurements as descoping these may become necessary to launch a mission by 2034. Voyager 2's brief flyby encounter with Uranus provided a glimpse at the complexity and uniqueness of the planet and ultimately motivated more questions than answers. Our current limited understanding of Uranus is analogous to that of other planets prior to long-lived orbital missions (e.g., after the Pioneer and Voyager missions to Jupiter and Saturn). Just as our understanding of those planets was transformed beyond expectations by dedicated orbiter missions (e.g., Galileo, Juno, Cassini), so too will our knowledge of Uranus expand from the necessary multi-year measurements and investigation. Flybys only provide limited snapshots of a planetary space environment at a given location and time. It is challenging, if not impossible, to characterize a system with such a limited in situ dataset. The only way to comprehensively understand Uranus is with an orbiting mission. Orbital missions have flown to every planet in our solar system except for the Ice Giants. At each planet these first orbiters revealed many surprises that were missed during the initial flybys. For example, a major discovery of Cassini was the eruption of material from the subsurface ocean of Enceladus, which was unnoticed by previous flybys. Future missions to Uranus will undoubtedly provide similar system-science surprises. A broad array of potential science objectives and outstanding mysteries covering all areas of the Uranus system (rings, satellites, magneto-sphere, atmosphere, and interior) could be addressed by such a mission. Though not explicitly defined here, a NF-class Uranus orbiter mission is expected to achieve many interdisciplinary science objectives. NF-class Design Considerations: Whereas a NF Uranus orbiter could be undertaken with current technologies, given appropriate trades in design, implementation, and scope, the mission would be significantly enhanced by future technologies. To achieve a meaningful NF-class Uranus orbiter mission, the mission design parameters must be assessed against completion of the science objectives, cost cap, and feasibility. In particular, studies that trade science scope and instrumentation/operational capabilities against simpler and cheaper options must be fundamental to the mission design. A high priority for a NF Uranus orbit-er should be to maintain a balance across research disciplines. A primary driver for the mission will be a total mission duration of no more than 14 years based on the flight design life of the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (MMRTGs). A typical baseline would be a two-year mission in orbit at Uranus with a system tour that enables surface mapping of the large satellites as well as spatial coverage of the planet and rings/small moons. Furthermore, the mission should be designed to complete its baseline mission by Uranus spring equinox (2049), enabling different illuminations of the satellites and seasonal orientation of the planet and magnetosphere than observed by Voyager 2. A significant driver of the mission design and subsequent design parameters is determination of the total mass that can be put into Uranus orbit within the NF cost cap. As such, the cost/risk-vs.-benefit of using aerocapture for orbit insertion should be considered. Because significant propellant mass is needed to put a spacecraft into orbit at Uranus ($\\sim$3 kg propellant per kg dry mass), mass efficiency is also critical to a mission's feasibility. A realistic $\\sim$60-kg payload (e.g. five instruments and radio science), would provide closure to several outstanding mysteries. Finally, power is perhaps the most limiting constraint on a Uranus orbiter mission and addressing power within cost is the primary obstacle to the feasibility of a NF Uranus orbiter mission. Previous Ice Giant mission studies have resulted in architectures requiring $&gt;$350 W-e end-of-life power, which requires six MMRTGs. Owing to the relative inefficiency and significant cost of MMRTGs, any design should attempt to reduce the needed end-of-life power; this will have significant impact on both the spacecraft and orbit design as well as the communication subsystem and payload. Other design considerations that place significant constraints on the feasibility of a NF Uranus orbiter include deep-space communications (specifically the power required for downlink) and radiation shielding mass.",

      "abstract": "The ice giant planets provide some of the most interesting natural laboratories for studying the influence of large obliquities, rapid rotation, highly asymmetric magnetic fields and wide-ranging Alfv\u00e9nic and sonic Mach numbers on magnetospheric processes. The geometries of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction at the ice giants vary dramatically on diurnal timescales due to the large tilt of the magnetic axis relative to each planet's rotational axis and the apparent off-centred nature of the magnetic field. There is also a seasonal effect on this interaction geometry due to the large obliquity of each planet (especially Uranus). With in situ observations at Uranus and Neptune limited to a single encounter by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, a growing number of analytical and numerical models have been put forward to characterize these unique magnetospheres and test hypotheses related to the magnetic structures and the distribution of plasma observed. Yet many questions regarding magnetospheric structure and dynamics, magnetospheric coupling to the ionosphere and atmosphere, and potential interactions with orbiting satellites remain unanswered. Continuing to study and explore ice giant magnetospheres is important for comparative planetology as they represent critical benchmarks on a broad spectrum of planetary magnetospheric interactions, and provide insight beyond the scope of our own Solar System with implications for exoplanet magnetospheres and magnetic reversals. <P />This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `Future exploration of ice giant systems'.",

It will explore how Uranus formed; how much it migrated after formation; the planet\u2019s interior structure, atmosphere, magnetosphere, and ring system; and whether any moons have or once had subsurface liquid water oceans. This mission will serve to inspire and educate multiple generations about solar system history and the mysteries at its farthest reaches.",

      "abstract": "Current knowledge of the Uranian system is limited to observations from the flyby of Voyager 2 and limited remote observations. However, Uranus remains a highly compelling scientific target due to the unique properties of many aspects of the planet itself and its system. Future exploration of Uranus must focus on cross-disciplinary science that spans the range of research areas from the planet's interior, atmosphere, and magnetosphere to the its rings and satellites, as well as the interactions between them. Detailed study of Uranus by an orbiter is crucial not only for valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system but also for providing ground truths for the understanding of exoplanets. As such, exploration of Uranus will not only enhance our understanding of the ice giant planets themselves but also extend to planetary dynamics throughout our solar system and beyond. The timeliness of exploring Uranus is great, as the community hopes to return in time to image unseen portions of the satellites and magnetospheric configurations. This urgency motivates evaluation of what science can be achieved with a lower-cost, potentially faster-turnaround mission, such as a New Frontiers-class orbiter mission. This paper outlines the scientific case for and the technological and design considerations that must be addressed by future studies to enable a New Frontiers-class Uranus orbiter with balanced cross-disciplinary science objectives. In particular, studies that trade scientific scope and instrumentation and operational capabilities against simpler and cheaper options must be fundamental to the mission formulation.",

They can be subdivided into the Ice Giants (Uranus and Neptune) and the Gas Giants (Jupiter and Saturn), which differ from each other in a number of fundamental ways. Uranus, in particular is the most challenging to our understanding of planetary formation and evolution, with its large obliquity, low self-luminosity, highly asymmetrical internal field, and puzzling internal structure. Uranus also has a rich planetary system consisting of a system of inner natural satellites and complex ring system, five major natural icy satellites, a system of irregular moons with varied dynamical histories, and a highly asymmetrical magnetosphere. Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have explored Uranus, with a flyby in 1986, and no mission is currently planned to this enigmatic system. However, a mission to the uranian system would open a new window on the origin and evolution of the Solar System and would provide crucial information on a wide variety of physicochemical processes in our Solar System. These have clear implications for understanding exoplanetary systems. In this paper we describe the science case for an orbital mission to Uranus with an atmospheric entry probe to sample the composition and atmospheric physics in Uranus' atmosphere. The characteristics of such an orbiter and a strawman scientific payload are described and we discuss the technical challenges for such a mission. This paper is based on a white paper submitted to the European Space Agency's call for science themes for its large-class mission programme in 2013.",

Ice Giants will be the last remaining class of Solar System planet to have a dedicated orbital explorer, and international efforts are under way to realise such an ambitious mission in the coming decades. In 2019, the European Space Agency released a call for scientific themes for its strategic science planning process for the 2030s and 2040s, known as Voyage 2050. We used this opportunity to review our present-day knowledge of the Uranus and Neptune systems, producing a revised and updated set of scientific questions and motivations for their exploration. This review article describes how such a mission could explore their origins, ice-rich interiors, dynamic atmospheres, unique magnetospheres, and myriad icy satellites, to address questions at the heart of modern planetary science. These two worlds are superb examples of how planets with shared origins can exhibit remarkably different evolutionary paths: Neptune as the archetype for Ice Giants, whereas Uranus may be atypical. Exploring Uranus' natural satellites and Neptune's captured moon Triton could reveal how Ocean Worlds form and remain active, redefining the extent of the habitable zone in our Solar System. For these reasons and more, we advocate that an Ice Giant System explorer should become a strategic cornerstone mission within ESA's Voyage 2050 programme, in partnership with international collaborators, and targeting launch opportunities in the early 2030s.",

Uranus's complex and dynamic magnetosphere presents a unique laboratory to study magnetospheric physics as well as its coupling to the solar wind and the planet's atmosphere, satellites, and rings. From the planet's tilted and offset, rapidly-rotating non-dipolar magnetic field to its seasonally-extreme interactions with the solar wind to its unexpectedly intense electron radiation belts, Uranus hosts a range of outstanding and compelling mysteries relevant to the space physics community. While the exploration of planets other than Earth has largely fallen within the purview of NASA's Planetary Science Division, many targets, like Uranus, also hold immense scientific value and interest to NASA's Heliophysics Division. Exploring and understanding Uranus's magnetosphere is critical to make fundamental gains in magnetospheric physics and the understanding of potential exoplanetary systems and to test the validity of our knowledge of magnetospheric dynamics, moon-magnetosphere interactions, magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, and solar wind-planetary coupling. The PERSEUS mission concept study, currently at Concept Maturity Level (CML) 4, comprises a feasible payload that provides closure to a range of space physics science objectives in a reliable and mature spacecraft and mission design architecture.

Studying these objects is important for furthering our understanding of the formation and evolution of the planets, and unravelling the fundamental physical and chemical processes in the Solar System. The importance of filling these gaps in our knowledge of the Solar System is particularly acute when trying to apply our understanding to the numerous planetary systems that have been discovered around other stars. The Uranus Pathfinder (UP) mission thus represents the quintessential aspects of the objectives of the European planetary community as expressed in ESA's Cosmic Vision 2015-2025. UP was proposed to the European Space Agency's M3 call for medium-class missions in 2010 and proposed to be the first orbiter of an Ice Giant planet. As the most accessible Ice Giant within the M-class mission envelope Uranus was identified as the mission target. Although not selected for this call the UP mission concept provides a baseline framework for the exploration of Uranus with existing low-cost platforms and underlines the need to develop power sources suitable for the outer Solar System. The UP science case is based around exploring the origins, evolution, and processes at work in Ice Giant planetary systems. Three broad themes were identified: (1) Uranus as an Ice Giant, (2) An Ice Giant planetary system, and (3) An asymmetric magnetosphere. Due to the long interplanetary transfer from Earth to Uranus a significant cruise-phase science theme was also developed. The UP mission concept calls for the use of a Mars Express/Rosetta-type platform to launch on a Soyuz-Fregat in 2021 and entering into an eccentric polar orbit around Uranus in the 2036-2037 timeframe. The science payload has a strong heritage in Europe and beyond and requires no significant technology developments.",

These radiate complex auroral emissions, both reminiscent of those observed at the other planets and unique to the ice giants, which have been detected at radio and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths to date. Our current knowledge of these radiations, which probe fundamental planetary properties (magnetic field, rotation period, magnetospheric processes, etc.), still mostly relies on Voyager 2 radio, UV and in situ measurements, when the spacecraft flew by each planet in the 1980s. These pioneering observations were, however, limited in time and sampled specific solar wind/magnetosphere configurations, which significantly vary at various timescales down to a fraction of a planetary rotation. Since then, despite repeated Earth-based observations at similar and other wavelengths, only the Uranian UV aurorae have been re-observed at scarce occasions by the Hubble Space Telescope. These observations revealed auroral features radically different from those seen by Voyager 2, diagnosing yet another solar wind/magnetosphere configuration. Perspectives for the in-depth study of the Uranian and Neptunian auroral processes, with implications for exoplanets, include follow-up remote Earth-based observations and future orbital exploration of one or both ice giant planetary systems. <P />This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `Future exploration of ice giant systems'.",

Presumed to have a small rocky core, a deep interior comprising \u223c70% heavy elements surrounded by a more dilute outer envelope of H2 and He, Uranus and Neptune are fundamentally different from the better-explored gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Because of the dearth of missions dedicated to their exploration, our knowledge of their composition and atmospheric processes is primarily derived from a single Voyager 2 flyby of each, complemented by subsequent remote sensing from Earth-based observatories, including space telescopes. As a result, Uranus's and Neptune's physical and atmospheric properties remain poorly constrained and their roles in the evolution of the Solar System are not well understood. Exploration of ice giant systems is therefore a high-priority science objective as these systems (which link together the magnetospheres, satellites, rings, atmosphere, and interior of these planets) challenge our understanding of planetary formation and evolution. Here we describe the main scientific goals to be addressed by future in situ exploration of an ice giant's atmosphere. An atmospheric entry probe targeting the 10-bar level, approximately 5 scale heights beneath the tropopause, would yield insight into two broad themes: i) the formation history of the ice giants and, in a broader extent, that of the Solar System, and ii) the processes governing the structure and composition of planetary atmospheres. The battery-powered probe would descend under parachute to measure composition, structure, and dynamics. In our favorite scenario, an Ice Giants orbiter performing a comprehensive exploration of the system would be used to deliver the probe to the atmosphere and to relay its data back to Earth. Following the successful architecture of the Cassini-Huygens mission, we envision that the probe would be delivered by ESA and the orbiter by NASA, with possible technical contributions of one Agency to the other's platform, on the basis of technical and programmatic considerations. The science payloads of the two platforms would be shared between NASA and ESA members states on the basis of scientific merit and technical/funding resources.",

Ice giants represent a fundamental class of planets, and many known exoplanets fall within this category. Therefore, a dedicated mission to an ice giant is crucial to improve the understanding of the formation, evolution and current characteristics of such planets in order to extend the knowledge of both the Solar System and exoplanetary systems. <P />In the study at hand, the rationale, selection, and conceptual design for a mission to investigate the Uranian system, as an archetype for ice giants, is presented. A structured analysis of science questions relating to the Uranian system is performed, categorized by the themes atmosphere, interior, moons and rings, and magnetosphere. In each theme, science questions are defined, with their relative importance in the theme quantified. Additionally, top-level weights for each theme are defined, with atmosphere and interior weighted the strongest, as they are more related to both exoplanetary systems and the Uranian system, than the other two themes (which are more specific for the planet itself). Several top level mission architecture aspects have been defined, from which the most promising concepts were generated using heuristic methods. A trade-off analysis of these concepts is presented, separately, for engineering aspects, such as cost, complexity, and risk, and for science aspects. The science score for each mission is generated from the capability of each mission concept to answer the science questions. The trade-off results in terms of relative science and engineering weight are presented, and competitive mission concepts are analyzed based on the preferred mission type. <P />A mission design point for a typical flagship science mission is selected from the trade space. It consists of a Uranus orbiter with a dry mass of 2073 kg including 402 kg of payload and a Uranus entry probe, which is to perform measurements down 100 bar atmospheric pressure. The orbiter science phase will consist of a Uranus orbit phase of approximately 2 years in a highly elliptical orbit, during which 36 Uranus orbits are performed. Subsequently, a moon phase is performed, during which the periapsis will be raised in five steps, facilitating 9 flybys of each of Uranus' major moons. A preliminary vehicle design is presented, seeking the best compromise between the design drivers, which basically derive from the large distance between Uranus and the Earth (e.g., high thermal load during Venus flyby, low thermal load during Uranus science phase, low data-rate during Uranus science phase, the need of radioisotope power source, etc). <P />This paper is the result of a study carried out during the Alpbach Summer School 2012 \"Exploration of the icy planets and their systems\" and a one-week follow-up meeting in Graz, Austria. The results of this study show that a flagship ESA L-class mission - consisting of an orbiter with a single atmospheric entry probe and flybys of the main satellites - would be able to address the set of science questions which are identified in the study at hand as the most essential for the understanding of Uranus and its system. The spacecraft, as currently designed, could be launched with an Ariane 5, in 2026, arriving at Uranus in 2044, and operating until 2050.
