  "title": "The Adhesive Response of Regolith to Low-Energy Disturbances in Microgravity",
  "abstract": "Small, airless bodies are covered by a layer of regolith composed of particles ranging from \u03bcm-size dust to cm-size pebbles that evolve under conditions very different than those on Earth. Flight-based microgravity experiments investigating low-velocity collisions of cm-size projectiles into regolith have revealed that certain impact events result in a mass transfer from the target regolith onto the surface of the projectile. The key parameters that produce these events need to be characterized to understand the mechanical behavior of granular media, which is composed of the surfaces of small bodies. We carried out flight and ground-based research campaigns designed to investigate these mass transfer events. The goals of our experimental campaigns were (1) to identify projectile energy thresholds that influence mass transfer outcomes in low-energy collision events between cm-size projectiles and \u03bcm-size regolith, (2) to determine whether these mass transfer events required a microgravity environment to be observed, and (3) to determine whether the rebound portion of these collision events could be replicated in a laboratory drop tower environment. We found that (1) mass transfer events occurred for projectile rebound accelerations &lt;7.8 m/s2 and we were unable to identify a corresponding impact velocity threshold, (2) mass transfer events require a microgravity environment, and (3) ourdrop tower experiments were able to produce mass transfer events. However, drop tower experiments do not exactly reproduce the free-particle impacts and rebound of the long-duration microgravity experiments and yielded systematically lower amounts of the overall mass transferred.",

      "abstract": "During the first stages of planet formation small particles (~0.1 \u2013 1 \u00b5m) in the protoplanetary disk collide at low relative velocities (less than 1 m/s) and tend to aggregate into cm-size \"pebbles\" through a combination of electrostatic interactions and gravitational streaming instabilities. Particles in this size regime also compose a layer of regolith on small, airless bodies that evolves under conditions very different than those on Earth. Characterizing the response of regolith to low-energy impacts in a microgravity environment is therefore critical to our understanding of the processes that lead to the formation of these objects and our ability to develop safe operation procedures on their surfaces. Flight-based microgravity experiments investigating low-velocity collisions of cm-size projectiles into regolith have revealed that certain impact events result in mass transfer from the target regolith onto the surface of the projectile. Characterizing the key parameters and their interactions that produce these events have important implications for the role of energy dissipation and accretion in planet formation processes and understanding the mechanical behavior of granular media composing the surfaces of small bodies. I carried out experimental and numerical campaigns designed to investigate these mass transfer events and found that accretion outcomes differ significantly depending on whether the projectile is launched into granular material or initially at rest before pulling away from the granular bed. I found that interaction effects between various parameters and the balance of the experiment design significantly influence mass transfer outcomes and must be taken into account for future experiment designs. I also present my contributions to a CubeSat mission that will provide the opportunity to observe tens of thousands of collisions between particles in the velocity and size regime relevant to the earliest stages of planet formation.",

Additionally, exploration and sample return missions to asteroids and other small, airless bodies involve low energy interactions with weakly-bound regolith particles. Therefore, to characterize the processes that lead to planetesimal formation and planetary ring collisional evolution, and to develop appropriate procedures for asteroid sample return missions, it is necessary to understand how regolith responds to low-energy collisions in a microgravity environment. The COLLIDE (Collisions Into Dust Experiment) and PRIME (Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment) programs produced observations of mass transfer of regolith onto cm-scale projectiles at impact velocities &lt; 40 cm/s in microgravity conditions. These experiments were carried out on orbit (COLLIDE, COLLIDE-2), in suborbital space (COLLIDE-3), and on parabolic airplane flights (PRIME) under vacuum. To study this phenomenon with significantly reduced cost and time constraints we have developed an experimental apparatus that makes use of a laboratory drop tower (free-fall time 0.75 s). The experiment consists of a tube pumped to vacuum conditions containing a cm-diameter marble suspended from a spring in contact with a bed of regolith. The spring contracts during free-fall allowing us to simulate the rebound portion of a low-velocity collision in a laboratory microgravity environment. We are also carrying out concurrent numerical simulations with the use of a discrete element method particle simulation program, LIGGGHTS (Kloss et al. 2012, Prog. Comp.

The COLLIDE (Collisions Into Dust Experiment) and PRIME (Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment) programs created impacts into simulated planetary regolith with cm-scale impactors to observe ejecta production and coefficients of restitution in microgravity. These experiments were carried out on orbit (COLLIDE, COLLIDE-2), in suborbital space (COLLIDE-3), and on parabolic airplane flights (PRIME) under vacuum. Some impacts at speeds less than 40 cm/s resulted in mass transfer from the target regolith onto the impactor. To study these mass-transfer collisions in more detail without the cost or time requirements of spaceflight or parabolic flights, we developed an experimental apparatus in a laboratory drop tower (free-fall time 0.75 s) and performed experiments at standard pressure. The impactor is suspended from a spring and remains in contact with the bed of regolith until free-fall allows the spring to retract and pull the impactor upwards. This method allowed us to simulate the rebound portion of a low-velocity collision in a laboratory microgravity environment. We achieved rebound velocities of 10 - 60 cm/s, and we observed mass transfer events with rebound speeds below 40 cm/s. The amount of mass transfer produced was more significant than a monolayer of granular material, but less than the amount observed in the COLLIDE and PRIME experiments. These mass-transfer collisions may play a role in the growth of planetesimals. We will present the results of our laboratory-based studies where we vary impact velocity and target material, and discuss implications for collisional evolution in the protoplanetary disk and planetary rings.",

This regolith evolves in a low ambient pressure and low-gravity environment. Its response to low-velocity impacts, such as those that may accompany human and robotic exploration activities, may be completely different than what is encountered on Earth. Experimental studies of the response of planetary regolith in the relevant environmental conditions are thus necessary to facilitate future Solar System exploration activities.We combined the results and provided new data analysis elements for a series of impact experiments into simulated planetary regolith in low-gravity conditions using two experimental setups and a range of microgravity platforms. The Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment (PRIME) flew on several parabolic aircraft flights, enabling the recording of impacts into granular materials at speeds of \u223c 4\u2013230 cm/s. The COLLisions Into Dust Experiment (COLLIDE) is conceptually close to the PRIME setup. It flew on the Space Shuttle in 1998 and 2001 and more recently on the Blue Origin New Shepard rocket, recording impacts into simulated regolith at speeds between 1 and 120 cm/s.Results of these experimental campaigns found that there is a significant change in the regolith behavior with the gravity environment. In a 10 <SUP>\u20112</SUP>g environment (with g being the gravity acceleration at the surface of the Earth), only embedding of the impactor was observed and ejecta production was produced for most impacts at &gt; 20 cm/s. Once at microgravity levels (&lt;10<SUP>\u20114</SUP>g), the lowest impact energies also produced impactor rebound. In these microgravity conditions, ejecta started to be produced for impacts at &gt; 10 cm/s. The measured ejecta speeds were somewhat lower than the ones measured at reduced-gravity levels, but the ejected masses were higher. In general, the mean ejecta velocity shows a power-law dependence on the impact energy with an index of \u223c 0.5. When projectile rebound occurred, we observed that its coefficients of restitution on the bed of regolith simulant decrease by a factor of 10 with increasing impact speeds from \u223c 5 up to 100 cm/s. We could also observe an increased cohesion between the JSC-1 grains compared to the quartz sand targets.",

The Collisions Into Dust Experiment (COLLIDE) and Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment (PRIME) experiments produced observations of mass transfer from regolith onto an impactor at these velocities in microgravity. We have subsequently carried out ground-based experiments in which a cm-scale sphere impacts and rebounds from a bed of granular material in 1-g laboratory conditions at low impact speeds with the aid of a spring. This allows impacts at v&lt;1 m/s and ensures rebound of the impactor, with the spring providing enough force to overcome gravity. Preliminary results from an impact of a brass impactor into sand (200-500 \u03bcm) produced a monolayer of granular material onto the impactor, but the grains are not cohesive enough to allow a significant mass transfer under these conditions. Further experiments with a range of regolith properties, impactor composition and surface properties, impact velocities, and atmospheric conditions will be performed in the laboratory to study the effects of each of these properties on the contact transfer of regolith onto the impactor. Further microgravity experiments with PRIME and in a small drop tower are planned to then study bulk mass transfer with conditions informed by the ground-based experiments. Impacts with the COLLIDE and PRIME microgravity experiments showed mass transfer at speeds &lt; 40 cm/s into JSC-1 lunar regolith simulant and quartz sand targets.

      "abstract": "In recent years, a number of new experiments have advanced our knowledge on the early growth phases of protoplanetary dust aggregates. Some of these experiments have shown that collisions between porous and compacted agglomerates at velocities above the fragmentation threshold velocity can lead to growth of the compact body, when the porous collision partner fragments upon impact and transfers mass to the compact agglomerate. To obtain a deeper understanding of this potentially important growth process, we performed laboratory and drop tower experiments to study multiple impacts of small, highly porous dust-aggregate projectiles onto sintered dust targets. The projectile and target consisted of 1.5 \u03bcm monodisperse, spherical SiO<SUB>2</SUB> monomers with volume filling factors of 0.15 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.45 \u00b1 0.05, respectively. The fragile projectiles were accelerated by a solenoid magnet and combined with a projectile magazine with which 25 impacts onto the same spot on the target could be performed in vacuum. We measured the mass-accretion efficiency and the volume filling factor for different impact velocities between 1.5 and 6.0 m s^{-1}. The experiments at the lowest impact speeds were performed in the Bremen drop tower under microgravity conditions to allow partial mass transfer also for the lowest adhesion case. Within this velocity range, we found a linear increase of the accretion efficiency with increasing velocity. In the laboratory experiments, the accretion efficiency increases from 0.12 to 0.21 in units of the projectile mass. The recorded images of the impacts showed that the mass transfer from the projectile to the target leads to the growth of a conical structure on the target after less than 100 impacts. From the images, we also measured the volume filling factors of the grown structures, which ranged from 0.15 (uncompacted) to 0.40 (significantly compacted) with increasing impact speed. The velocity dependency of the mass-transfer efficiency and the packing density of the resulting aggregates augment our knowledge of the aggregate growth in protoplanetary disks and should be taken into account for future models of protoplanetary dust growth.",

Target and projectile are dust aggregates consisting of micrometer-sized SiO <SUB>2</SUB> particles. Collision velocities range up to 25 m/s. The general outcome of a collision strongly depends on the impact velocity. For collisions below 13 m/s rebound and a small degree of fragmentation occur. However, at higher collision velocities up to 25 m/s approximately 50% of the mass of the projectile rigidly sticks to the target after the collision. Thus, net growth of a body is possible in high speed collisions. This supports the idea that planetesimal formation via collisional growth is a viable mechanism at higher impact velocities. Within our set of parameters the experiments even suggest that higher impact velocities might be preferable for growth in collisions between dusty bodies. For the highest impact velocities most of the ejecta is within small dust aggregates about 500 \u03bcm in size. In detail the size distribution of ejected dust aggregates is flat for very small particles smaller than 500 \u03bcm and follows a power law for larger ejected dust aggregates with a power of -5.6\u00b10.2. There is a sharp upper cut-off at about 1 mm in size with only a few particles being slightly larger. The ejection angle is smaller than 3\u00b0 with respect to the target surface.

PRIME can perform impacts into granular materials at speeds of ~5-50 cm/s in microgravity. Impacts are performed in vacuum and projectiles are spherical particles launched by a spring designed to provide the desired impact energy. The target materials studied are quartz sand and JSC-1 lunar regolith simulant, filled to a depth of 2 cm in the target tray. Projectile materials are quartz, brass, and stainless steel to provide a range of impact energies at constant impact velocity. Impacts are performed in isolated chambers and up to 8 experiments can be performed per flight. The data collected consists of video recordings of the impacts, taken with a high resolution video camera at 120 frames per second. The impacts observed during the PRIME-3 campaign resulted in 9 marble rebounds and 15 impacts with ejecta. Seven of these 15 were at accelerations of ~0.05 g while the remaining impacts were performed in free fall. For each rebound observed, the coefficient of restitution of the impact was measured and for each collision that produced ejecta, the ejected particles were tracked to determine their initial velocities. The PRIME-3 campaign successfully extended the region of the parameter field explored by investigating impacts at velocities lower than observed during previous campaigns while collecting new data on impacts at asteroid gravity levels. We present our new results and combine them with results from previous similar experiments and discuss applications to planetary ring systems, planetesimal accretion, and in situ exploration of asteroids and small planetary satellites.",

Dust projectiles and solid projectiles of several mm in size impacted a dust target 5 cm in depth and width at velocities between 3.5 and 21.5 m/s. For solid impactors we found significant mass loss on the front (impact) side of the target. Mass loss depended on the impact velocity and projectile type (solid sphere or dust) and was up to 35 times the projectile mass for targets of the lowest tensile strength. Typical fragment velocities on the front side of the target ranged from 3 to 12 cm/s. The ejecta velocity was independent of the impact velocity but it increased with projectile mass. On the back side of the target (opposite to the impact side) mass was ejected from the target above a certain threshold impact velocity. Ejection velocity on the back side increased with impact velocity and is larger for solid projectiles than for dust projectiles. In one case a slightly stronger target gained mass in a slow dust-dust collision. We verified that collisions of dust projectiles with compact, very strong dust targets lead to a more massive target accreting part of the projectile. Applied to planetesimal formation, the experiments suggest that the maximum possible ejecta velocity from a body of several cm in size after a collision is small. Ejecta were slow enough that they were reaccreted by means of gas flow if large pores were part of the body's morphology. While very weak bodies cannot grow in the primary collision at the given velocities, this can lead to growth by secondary collisions. Slight compression, which could result from preceding collisions, might lead to immediate growth of a body in slow collisions by adding projectile mass.",

For normal incidence impacts, characteristic ejecta velocities increase with impactor kinetic energy, KE, as approximately KE<SUP>0.5</SUP>. Ejecta masses could not be measured accurately due to the nature of the experiment, but qualitatively also increased with impactor kinetic energy. Some experiments were near the threshold velocity of 0.2 m/s identified in previous microgravity impact experiments as the minimum velocity needed to produce ejecta [Colwell, J.E., 2003. Icarus 164, 188-196], and the experimental scatter is large at these low speeds in the airplane experiment. A more precise exploration of the transition from low-ejecta-mass impacts to high-ejecta-mass impacts requires a longer and smoother period of reduced gravity. Coefficient of restitution measurements are not possible due to the varying acceleration of the airplane throughout the experiment.",

We performed laboratory experiments to study the collisional behavior of dust aggregates in this size range at velocities below and around the fragmentation threshold. We developed two independent experimental setups with the same goal: to study the effects of bouncing, fragmentation, and mass transfer in free particle-particle collisions. The first setup is an evacuated drop tower with a free-fall height of 1.5 m, providing us with 0.56 s of microgravity time, so that we observed collisions with velocities between 8 mm s<SUP>-1</SUP> and 2 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The second setup is designed to study the effect of partial fragmentation (when only one of the two aggregates is destroyed) and mass transfer in more detail. It allows for the measurement of the accretion efficiency because the samples are safely recovered after the encounter. At very low velocities, we found that bouncing was as expected, while the fragmentation velocity of 20 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP> was significantly lower than expected. We present the critical energy for disruptive collisions Q <SUP>sstarf</SUP>, which were at least two orders of magnitude lower than previous experiments in the literature. In the wide range between bouncing and disruptive collisions, only one of the samples fragmented in the encounter, while the other gained mass. The accretion efficiency on the order of a few percentage points of the particle's mass depends on the impact velocity and the sample porosity. Our results will have consequences for dust evolution models in protoplanetary disks as well as for the strength of large, porous planetesimal bodies.",

      "abstract": "This work presents the results from a set of low-velocity impact simulations that were performed using the soft-sphere Discrete Element Method and two different codes: pkdgrav and Chrono. In these tests, a spherical projectile is dropped onto a bed of glass beads, where the size of the container, the size of the beads, the impact velocity of the projectile, and the gravity-level are varied. First, the simulation results are compared against experimental data and theoretical collision behaviors. Then, the results from pkdgrav and Chrono are examined in more detail and are compared in terms of output and performance differences.IntroductionThe robotic exploration of small-body surfaces often involves the direct interaction between a slow-moving mechanism and a bed of loose regolith. Take, for instance, the two most recent missions to near-Earth asteroids. In 2018 and 2019, the Hayabusa2 spacecraft deployed several landers to the surface of the asteroid Ryugu [9]. In October of this year, the OSIRIS-REx mission will collect a sample from the surface of the asteroid Bennu using a \"touch-and-go\" mechanism [2]. One way to develop our understanding of lander-surface interactions is to study low-velocity collisions dynamics for penetrators of diverse shapes and sizes.The motion of spherical, cylindrical, and conical penetrators through different granular media has been extensively studied for the terrestrial gravity environment [1] but much less so for low-gravity levels. [3] and [4] conducted low-velocity impact experiments under both Earth and reduced-gravity conditions using two different projectile shapes (spherical and cubic) and four different granular surface materials (quartz sand and 1.5 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm glass beads). The Earth-gravity tests were completed using a static laboratory set-up, while the reduced-gravity tests were performed using an Atwood-type drop-tower [7]. In both configurations, in-situ accelerometers were used to monitor the projectile\"s motion.[4] discuss the dependency of certain collision parameters, like collision duration and collision depth, on gravity-level. However, the work examines a limited range of collision cases. Due to internal friction and sizing constraints, the ISAE-Supa\u00e9ro drop-tower can only reach gravity levels spanning from 0.2 to 1.5 m/s^2. The easiest way to compliment the experimental study is through numerical modeling. This work replicates and expands upon a sub-set of the impact experiments performed by [3] and [4].SimulationsThe numerical simulations presented in this study are conducted using two different codes. The first code, pkdgrav, is frequently used for small-body related studies [5]. The second code, Chrono, is presented as an open-source alternative to pkdgrav [7, 8]. One objective of this work is to validate the Chrono code by comparing the simulation results against observations from pkdgrav, collision theory, and laboratory experiments. A second objective is to compare Chrono and pkdgrav in terms of input parameters, results, and overall computational performance.At this time, simulations are restricted to the \"static\" (1g) set-up with the spherical projectile and the glass-bead surface material. In the static experiments, a 1 kg, 10 cm diameter sphere is dropped into an aluminum bucket with a base diameter of 31.5 cm and a rim diameter of 35 cm (Fig. 1). The fill height of the bucket ranges from 1 to 17 cm, and the impact velocity of the projectile varies from approximately 0 to 1.2 m/s.For simplicity, the simulations assume that the bucket has a constant diameter and that the container is filled with either 5 mm or 10 mm diameter glass beads (Fig 2). In order to investigate the influence of the container size on the collision behavior of the projectile, the diameter and fill height of the bucket are varied from 31.5 and 40 cm and from 2 to 18 cm respectively. Though experimental data for this set-up only exists for the 1g case (g = 9.81 m/s2), simulations are conducted for gravity levels ranging from 0.2 to 9.81 m/s2.ResultsThe simulations are in general agreement with trends observed in the 1g impact experiments from [4]. The results are discussed within the context of existing collision models and theories and are used to identify the optimal material properties for the simulated glass beads. The coefficients of friction differ between pkdgrav and Chrono. This is to be expected, since the two codes implement different friction models. Similarly, the computation times vary due to differences in the codes\" architectures and parallelization methods.Both the experiments and simulations show that the container fill height does not influence collision behavior as long as the particle bed is at least 8 cm deep, at least for the test cases where g = 9.81 m/s^2. Chrono is used to determine if the same conclusion applies for test cases where g = 0.2 m/s^2, or the lowest gravity-level obtained by the drop-tower set-up.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank ISAE-Supa\u00e9ro and the Centre National d\"\u00c9tudes Spatiales (CNES) for financially supporting this research effort.References[1] Clark, Abram H., and Robert P.

At lower collision energies, only the projectile gets destroyed and mass is transferred to the target. The accretion efficiency decreases with increasing obliquity and increasing difference in filling factor, if the projectile is more compact than the target. The accretion efficiency increases with increasing collision energy for collision energies under a certain threshold. Beyond this threshold at 298 \u00b1 25 mJ, catastrophic disruption of the target can be observed. This corresponds to a critical fragmentation strength Q* = 190 \u00b1 16 mJ kg<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is a factor of four larger than expected. Analyses of the projectile fragments show a power-law size distribution with an average exponent of -3.8 \u00b1 0.3.

This is interesting for impacts of small particles on large target bodies within protoplanetary disks, as smaller fragments couple better to the surrounding gas and re-accretion by gas drag is more likely.",

      "abstract": "Asteroids are small solid bodies that formed during the early stages of the solar system, even before the formation of our own planet. Asteroids have been known to strike our planet Earth ever since its formation, causing a great threat to all existing life forms. One of the means to avert a potential collision of an asteroid with Earth is to deflect the asteroid away from its trajectory towards Earth by means of an impacting spacecraft. This idea is already part of mission designs such as AIDA (Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment). <P />The study of the surfaces of numerous asteroids through spacecraft, ground-based spectroscopic observations and other techniques has revealed that the surfaces of these small bodies are covered with loose, granular, heterogeneous geological material. This is called 'regolith'. If an impactor were to collide with an asteroid, the physical phenomenon that needs to be understood is the reaction of the regolith to the impact. To understand the deflection of the asteroid, the transfer of momentum from the impactor to the asteroid needs to be characterised. The impact can produce ejecta which would also add momentum to the target. Therefore, there are two components to this momentum gained by target body: (1) direct transfer of momentum from the impactor to the asteroid, (2) momentum caused by ejecta flying in the direction opposite to that of the impactor. The momentum transfer can thus be described by the so-called momentum multiplication factor \u03b2, which is the ratio of the momentum gained by the target to the momentum of the impactor at the time of collision. In this work, small-scale impact experiments using polyvinylchloride (PVC) projectiles on regolith-like materials and simulants - sand, glass beads and the Johnson Space Center (JSC)-1A lunar regolith simulant - have been conducted. We used the electro-thermal accelerator of the Technical University of Munich (TUM)/Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Raumfahrttechnik (LRT) to determine the momentum transfer from the projectiles onto these regolith targets. We derived relationships between the kinetic energy and the crater mass and characterized the ejecta cloud. We confirmed the dependency of \u03b2 on the impact velocity of the projectile (impactor) - higher momentum transfer occurs at larger impact velocities. We have also seen a trend that \u03b2 gets larger for a lower cohesion and higher porosity of the target material. Thus, a thorough understanding of the regolith properties of AIDA's target asteroid will be crucial towards understanding and determining the momentum transfer.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The dusty regolith covering the surfaces of asteroids and planetary satellites is subject to environmental conditions very different from those found on Earth. This regolith evolves at low ambient pressures and gravity levels. Its response to slow impacts, such as those occurring upon secondary impacts on small bodies or in planetary ring environments, may be completely different than what is intuitively expected. We carried out a series of impact experiments into simulated planetary regolith in zero- and reduced-gravity conditions using a range of microgravity platforms. Coefficient of Restitution: For speeds &gt;30 cm/s, impacts systematically produced an ejecta blanket and coefficients of restitution of the projectile were of the order of 10<SUP>-2</SUP>. Below 20 cm/s, only rebounds without ejecta were observed, with coefficients of restitution rising up to 0.3. Our results showed a similar power law index than the value of -1/4 found in 1g. This is twice as high as expected from the theory of an elastic sphere impacting a plane surface and indicates that energy absorption in a bed of granular material is not entirely captured by the mechanics of elastic surfaces. Penetration Depth: We determined the maximum penetration depth of the projectile into the target (z<SUB>max</SUB>). No correlation between z<SUB>max</SUB> and the equivalent total drop distance (H) was observed. This is in contrast with the relation z<SUB>max</SUB> H<SUP>-1/3</SUP> observed in 1g. Instead, we showed that the penetration depth scales with the quantity \u00b5<SUP>-1</SUP>(\u03c1<SUB>p</SUB>/\u03c1<SUB>g</SUB>)<SUP>0.1</SUP>D<SUB>p</SUB><SUP>2/3</SUP> H<SUP>-1/3</SUP>, with \u00b5 the coefficient of friction of the target material, \u03c1 the density of the target (g) and projectile (p), and D<SUB>p</SUB> the projectile diameter. Conclusion: Our experiments show projectile rebound off the target in microgravity (&lt;10<SUP>-4</SUP>g). None of the impacts in 1g and reduced gravity (0.05g) displayed a similar behavior. The projectile penetration depth into the target in microgravity was observed to depend more on the projectile size and energy and less on its density difference with the target than in 1g. These experiments show that the ambient gravity has a significant influence on the behavior of granular material on small bodies of the Solar System.",

      "abstract": "We performed laboratory as well as microgravity experiments in which we studied the impact of small fractal aggregates consisting of micrometer-sized dust particles onto solid targets at various velocities. Slow bombardment of the target in the laboratory results in the formation of a fluffy dust layer in which gravity-induced compaction is observed. In order to reduce the gravitational aggregate restructuring and, hence, to investigate the collisional behavior of fluffy dust aggregates, we performed additional experiments in the microgravity environment of a drop tower. We observe that the agglomerates are disrupted as long as the impact velocities are above a few meters per second. For slightly lower collision velocities, both sticking to and removal from the target are detected. At even lower velocities, the impinging dust agglomerates are captured by the target with a sticking probability of unity, and a compact dust layer forms. When the impact energies are no longer sufficiently large to allow for agglomerate restructuring, the internal structures of the impacting aggregates are preserved, and we observe the growth of a very porous dust layer. The results of our experiments are in qualitative, but not in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions. Full quantitative accordance between computer simulations and experiments can be reached when the recently measured values for the rolling friction force F<SUB>roll</SUB>=1.2\u00d710 <SUP>-9</SUP> N and for the break-up energy E<SUB>br</SUB>=1.3\u00d710 <SUP>-15</SUP> J (valid for 1.9-\u03bcm-diameter SiO <SUB>2</SUB> spheres) are used. Our experimental results suggest that aggregate restructuring in the solar nebula, and hence, the gradual increase of the fractal dimensionality of the dust agglomerates, becomes an important process when the aggregate diameters exceed a few centimeters. Dust aggregates below that size are not expected to be subjected to impact compaction.",

Stemm1, 1Department of Physics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, 2Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado. Impacts and cratering in space play important roles in the formation and evolution of planetary bodies. Low-velocity impacts and disturbances to planetary regolith are also a consequence of manned and robotic exploration of planetary bodies such as the Moon, Mars, and asteroids. We are conducting a program of laboratory experiments to study low-velocity impacts of 1 to 5 m/s into JSC-1 lunar regolith simulant, JSC-Mars-1 Martian regolith simulant, and silica targets under 1 g. We use direct measurement of ejecta mass and high-resolution video tracking of ejecta particle trajectories to derive ejecta mass velocity distributions. Additionally, we conduct similar experiments under microgravity conditions in a laboratory drop tower and on parabolic aircraft with velocities as low as 10 cm/s. We wish to characterize and understand the collision parameters that control the outcome of low-velocity impacts into regolith, including impact velocity, impactor mass, target shape and size distribution, regolith depth, target relative density, and crater depth, and to experimentally determine the functional dependencies of the outcomes of low-velocity collisions (ejecta mass and ejecta velocities) on the controlling parameters of the collision. We present results from our ongoing study showing the positive correlation between impact energy and ejecta mass. The total ejecta mass is also dependent on the packing density (porosity) of the regolith. We find that ejecta mass velocity fits a power-law or broken power-law distribution. Our goal is to understand the physics of ejecta production and regolith compaction in low-energy impacts and experimentally validate predictive models for dust flow and deposition. We will present our results from one-g and microgravity impact experiments.",
