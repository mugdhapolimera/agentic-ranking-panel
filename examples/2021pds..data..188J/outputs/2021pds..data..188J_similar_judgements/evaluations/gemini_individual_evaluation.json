    "3": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result is similar to Result 2, giving a general overview of the Cassini UVIS instrument and its objectives, with a section dedicated to Saturn's rings. It is relevant because it highlights the instrument and its intended uses for ring study, but it lacks the specific focus on solar occultations."
    },
    "4": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is highly relevant. It discusses Cassini UVIS stellar occultation observations of Saturn's rings and details the data processing techniques. The focus on occultations and ring structure is directly aligned with the main paper's topic, though it focuses on stellar rather than solar occultations."
    },
    "5": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result focuses on Saturn's thermosphere using Cassini UVIS stellar occultations. While it uses the same instrument and occultation technique, it's not directly related to the study of Saturn's rings, making it only tangentially relevant."
    },
    "6": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result is highly relevant as it specifically discusses Cassini UVIS solar occultations by Saturn's F ring and the detection of collision-produced dust. It aligns perfectly with the main paper's topic and uses the same instrument and observation type."
    },
    "7": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result discusses particle sizes and self-gravity wakes in Saturn's rings using both UVIS and VIMS stellar occultations. While it doesn't focus solely on solar occultations or UVIS, it combines data from different instruments to study ring properties, making it relevant."
    },
    "8": {
      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "This result is about Enceladus' water vapor plume and uses UVIS stellar occultations. It's not related to Saturn's rings or solar occultations, making it irrelevant."
    },
    "9": {
      "score": 0,
      "explanation": "Similar to Result 8, this result focuses on the composition and structure of the Enceladus plume using UVIS solar occultations. It's not related to Saturn's rings, making it irrelevant."
    },
    "10": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "This result provides an overview of the 41 solar occultations of Saturn's rings observed by Cassini UVIS. It is highly relevant, directly addressing the main paper's topic and describing the data and its potential for analysis."
    },
    "11": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result discusses estimating the masses of Saturn's A and B rings from N-body simulations and stellar occultations. While it mentions UVIS stellar occultation data, the primary focus is on mass estimation and simulations, making it somewhat relevant but tangential."
    },
    "12": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result focuses on the dynamics of self-gravity wakes in the Mimas 5:3 bending wave and uses Cassini UVIS stellar occultations. While it uses UVIS data, its focus on wave dynamics is not the central theme of the main paper, so it's only tangentially relevant."
    },
    "13": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result discusses seasonal variation of Saturn's Lyman alpha airglow and upper atmospheric hydrogen using Cassini/UVIS. While it uses the same instrument, it is focused on Saturn's atmosphere, not the rings, making it only somewhat relevant."
    },
    "14": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result compares Cassini and Voyager observations of Saturn in Lyman alpha. Similar to result 13, it focuses on the atmosphere rather than the rings, making it only somewhat relevant."
    },
    "15": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result discusses the structure of the Mimas 5:3 Bending Wave in Saturn's Rings. While it uses Cassini UVIS stellar occultations, its focus on wave dynamics is not the central theme of the main paper, so it's only tangentially relevant."

    "16": {
      "score": 1,
      "explanation": "This result focuses on ultraviolet measurements of atomic hydrogen in Saturn's upper atmosphere using the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS). While it leverages the same instrument, its focus on the atmosphere rather than the rings makes it only somewhat relevant."
    },
    "17": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result discusses autocorrelation and skewness of Cassini UVIS stellar occultations to reveal structures in Saturn's rings. The use of UVIS stellar occultations for ring structure analysis makes it relevant, although it is not focused on solar occultations."

    "18": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result focuses on particle sizes in Saturn's rings from UVIS stellar occultations, specifically looking at outlier populations in the C ring and Cassini Division. The analysis of rings with UVIS data makes it relevant, though the focus is on stellar occultations."

    "19": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "This result discusses the smallest structures in Saturn's rings using UVIS stellar occultations. While it uses stellar occultations instead of solar, the focus on ring structure using UVIS makes it relevant."

    "suggestions": [
      "Prioritize results that specifically mention solar occultations of Saturn's rings by Cassini UVIS.",
      "Filter results based on their methodological alignment with the main paper, focusing on studies that analyze ring structure, particle size, or optical depth using occultation data.",
      "Consider results that combine UVIS data with other instruments to gain a more complete understanding of the rings, but ensure the UVIS data and ring analysis are substantial components of the research."
