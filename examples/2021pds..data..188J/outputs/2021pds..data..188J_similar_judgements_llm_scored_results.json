These solar occultations complement the set of stellar occultations measured by the broadband UVIS High Speed Photometer in the far ultraviolet (110-190 nm). We provide a uniform calibration of all of the UVIS solar occultation data across the full ring system. We have compiled complete catalogs of these occultations as high-level data products delivered to the Planetary Data System (PDS) Ring Moon Systems Node. This manuscript serves as a guide to this dataset and the corresponding high-level data products outlining their value for analysis of Saturn's rings. These products include light curves and optical depth profiles as functions of ring radius. In addition to providing key parameters of interest obtained through each of these occultations, we show that the optical depths of various ring regions derived from solar occultations are consistent with those from stellar occultations. We also demonstrate that fits to self-gravity wake parameters are similar for solar and stellar occultations. Lastly, we identify a variety of potential spectral trends at various ring locations that future investigations may further explore to address key questions pertaining to the properties of Saturn's rings.",

This inversion of the occultation data depends on accurate calibration of the data so that occultations of different stars taken at different times and under different viewing conditions can be combined to retrieve ring structure.

      "abstract": "We retrieved the density and temperature profiles in Saturn's thermosphere from 26 stellar occultations observed by the Cassini/UVIS instrument. These results expand upon and complement the previous analysis of 15 Cassini/UVIS solar occultations by Saturn's upper thermosphere. We find that the exospheric temperatures based on the stellar occultations agree with the solar occultations and range from 380 K to 590 K. These temperatures are also consistent with the recent re-analysis of the Voyager/UVS occultations. The retrieved density profiles support our earlier inference that the shape of the atmosphere at low pressures is consistent with a meridional trend of increasing temperatures with absolute latitude. This implies a high-latitude heat source, such as auroral heating, although the existing circulation models that include auroral heating still underestimate the equatorial temperatures by overestimating the meridional temperature gradient. This suggests either that the circulation models are somehow incomplete or there is some other heat source at low to mid latitudes that is relatively less efficient than high-latitude heating. We also find evidence for the expansion of the exobase by about 500 km between 2006 and 2011 near the equator, followed by possible contraction after 2011. The expansion appears to be caused by significant warming of the lower thermosphere that anti-correlates with solar activity and may be connected to changes in global circulation. Lastly, we note that our density profiles are in good general agreement with the Voyager/UVS data. In particular, the Voyager density profiles are most consistent with the Cassini/UVIS stellar occultations from late 2008 and early 2009 that roughly coincide in season with the Voyager flybys.",

      "abstract": "We present an analysis of eleven solar occultations by Saturn's F ring observed by the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) on the Cassini spacecraft. In four of the solar occultations we detect an unambiguous signal from diffracted sunlight that adds to the direct solar signal just before or after the occultations occur. The strongest detection was a 10% increase over the direct signal that was enabled by the accidental misalignment of the instrument's pointing. We compare the UVIS data with images of the F ring obtained by the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) and find that in each instance of an unambiguous diffraction signature in the UVIS data, the ISS data shows that there was a recent disturbance in that region of the F ring. Similarly, the ISS images show a quiescent region of the F ring for all solar occultations in which no diffraction signature was detected. We therefore conclude that collisions in the F ring produce a population of small ring particles that can produce a detectable diffraction signal immediately interior or exterior to the F ring. The clearest example of this connection comes from the strong detection of diffracted light in the 2007 solar occultation, when the portion of the F ring that occulted the Sun had suffered a large collisional event, likely with S/2004 S 6, several months prior. This collision was observed in a series of ISS images (Murray et al., 2008). <P />Our spectral analysis of the data shows no significant spectral features in the F ring, indicating that the particles must be at least 0.2 \u03bcm in radius. We apply a forward model of the solar occultations, accounting for the effects of diffracted light and the attenuated direct solar signal, to model the observed solar occultation light curves. These models constrain the optical depth, radial width, and particle size distribution of the F ring. We find that when the diffraction signature is present, we can best reproduce the occultation data using a particle population with an average effective particle size of less than 300 \u03bcm, while occultations without clear diffraction signals are best modeled using a population with an effective particle size larger than 400 \u03bcm.",

      "abstract": "The distribution of particle sizes in Saturn's rings roughly follows a truncated inverse power-law. Though it is well known that differential optical depths provide a way to probe the parameters of size distribution (i.e. Zebker et al. [1985] Icarus, 64, 531-548), the technique is complicated by the presence of self-gravity wakes which introduce a geometric dependence to the observed optical depth. Here we present a method of extracting information about the size distribution of the particles in the gaps between the self-gravity wakes. The Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) occultations measure starlight at an effective wavelength of 2.9 \u03bcm falling onto a single pixel with angular dimensions 0.25 mrad \u00d7 0.5 mrad while Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) occultations measure starlight at a much smaller effective wavelength of 0.15 \u03bcm and over a field of view with larger angular dimensions of 6.0 mrad \u00d7 6.4 mrad. Starlight diffracted out of the VIMS pixel by particles smaller than 1.22\u03bb<SUB>VIMS</SUB>/2\u03b8 \u223c8.86 mm, is not replaced by neighboring particles, while the UVIS instrument, with its larger field of view and smaller effective wavelength, collects all of the light diffracted by particles larger than 1.22\u03bb<SUB>VIMS</SUB>/2\u03b8 \u223c0.025 mm. Consequently, measurements by VIMS overstate the optical depth in regions where sub-centimeter-sized particles are present. Using the rectangular cross section wake model of (Colwell et al. [2006], Geophys. Res. Lett., 33, L07201) and (Colwell et al. [2007] Icarus, 190, 127-144) with a new parameter to represent the excess VIMS optical depth not seen by UVIS, we combine VIMS and UVIS occultations for the first time for particle size analysis. We find a significant fraction of sub-cm particles only in the outermost portion of the A ring, and in the B1 region of the B ring. In the Trans-Encke region, we find a trend of increasing abundance of sub-cm particles as the outer edge of the A Ring is approached, consistent with previous differential optical depth studies at radio wavelengths (Zebker et al. [1985] Icarus, 64, 531-548), measurements of diffraction in stellar occultations at the ring edges (Becker et al. [2015] Icarus), and measurements from VIMS solar occultations (Harbison et al. [2013] Icarus, 226, 1225-1240). This may be due to greater erosion of weakly bound particle aggregates by interparticle collisions in regions where satellite perturbations are strong.",

      "abstract": "We have completed a series of local N-body simulations of Saturn's B and A rings in order to identify systematic differences in the degree of particle clumping into self-gravity wakes as a function of orbital distance from Saturn and dynamical optical depth (a function of surface density). These simulations revealed that the normal optical depth of the final configuration can be substantially lower than one would infer from a uniform distribution of particles. Adding more particles to the simulation simply piles more particles onto the self-gravity wakes while leaving relatively clear gaps between the wakes. Estimating the mass from the observed optical depth is therefore a non-linear problem. These simulations may explain why the Cassini UVIS instrument has detected starlight at low incidence angles through regions of the B ring that have average normal optical depths substantially greater than unity at some observation geometries [Colwell, J.E., Esposito, L.W., Srem\u010devi\u0107, M., Stewart, G.R., McClintock, W.E., 2007. Icarus 190, 127-144]. We provide a plausible internal density of the particles in the A and B rings based upon fitting the results of our simulations with Cassini UVIS stellar occultation data. We simulated Cassini-like occultations through our simulation cells, calculated optical depths, and attempted to extrapolate to the values that Cassini observes. We needed to extrapolate because even initial optical depths of &gt;4 ( \u03c3 &gt; 240 g cm <SUP>-2</SUP>) only yielded final optical depths no greater than 2.8, smaller than the largest measured B ring optical depths. This extrapolation introduces a significant amount of uncertainty, and we chose to be conservative in our overall mass estimates. From our simulations, we infer the surface density of the A ring to be \u03c3=42-54gcm, which corresponds to a mass of 0.5\u00d710<SUP>19</SUP>kg-0.7\u00d710<SUP>19</SUP>kg. We infer a minimum surface density of \u03c3=240-480gcm for Saturn's B ring, which corresponds to a minimum mass estimate of 4\u00d710<SUP>19</SUP>kg-7\u00d710<SUP>19</SUP>kg. The A ring mass estimate agrees well with previous analyses, while the B ring is at least 40% larger. In sum, our lower limit estimate is that the total mass of Saturn's ring system is 120-200% the mass of the moon Mimas, but significantly larger values would be plausible given the limitations of our simulations. A significantly larger mass for Saturn's rings favors a primordial origin for the rings because the disruption of a former satellite of the required mass would be unlikely after the decay of the late heavy bombardment of planetary surfaces.",

      "abstract": "The satellite Mimas launches a bending wave - a warping of the rings that propagates radially through self-gravity - at the 5:3 inner vertical resonance with Saturn's rings. We present a modification of the linear bending wave theory (Shu et al., 1983) which includes the effects of satellite self-gravity wakes on the particles in the wave. We show that, when treated as rigid, these wakes generate an extra layer of particles whose number density is proportional to the magnitude of the slope of the warped ring. Using a ray-tracing code we compare our predictions with those of Shu et al. (1983) and with 60 stellar occultations observed by the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) and find that the extra layer of particles of our perturbed bending wave model has a considerable explanatory power for the UVIS dataset. Our best model explains the most discrepant and surprising features of the Mimas 5:3 bending wave; the enhancement of the signal for the cases of occultations with high ring opening angle and the bigger-than-expected viscosity, \u03bd = 576 cm<SUP>2</SUP>/s, which is more than double the viscosity computed from density waves (Tiscareno et al., 2007). This shows that self-gravity wakes can be effective at transporting angular momentum in a vertically perturbed disk. Relative to neighboring density waves (Tiscareno et al., 2007), we find a lower-than-expected value for the surface mass density, \u03c3 = 36.7 g/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, which suggests that the enhanced viscous interactions may be transporting material into the surrounding regions.",

      "abstract": "Saturn's Lyman \u03b1 airglow, emitted from upper atmospheric atomic hydrogen, was observed by Cassini's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) from 2003 to 2017. These airglow emission observations provide measurements across the Saturn disk over short timespans (5-17 hours), allowing for the examination of latitudinal structure and seasonal variations in the atomic hydrogen distribution. Lyman \u03b1 emissions are strongly absorbed below the methane homopause, which serves as the lower boundary of the emitting column. In this study, we have analyzed Lyman \u03b1 brightness data covering the entirety of the Cassini mission, away from auroral latitudes. In order to further examine the calibration of the Cassini/UVIS instrument at Lyman alpha, we compare background interplanetary hydrogen (IPH) observations with a model of the interaction between the solar wind and interstellar plasma. This model, informed by SWAN and BepiColombo/PHEBUS observations, demonstrates a close agreement with Cassini/UVIS measurements of the IPH Lyman \u03b1. A multivariate regression analysis of dayside Lyman \u03b1 brightnesses confirms that resonance scattering is the primary driver of emissions in Saturn's upper atmosphere. The incident solar flux, latitude, emission angle, and incidence angle are key drivers of the observed Lyman \u03b1 brightness. Furthermore, we compare the Lyman \u03b1 brightnesses with a radiative transfer model based on the doubling and adding of thin atmospheric layers. This approach allowed us to retrieve the effective optical depth of the atmospheric hydrogen column above the methane homopause. We compare the optical depths to the predictions from our photochemical model for Saturn's stratosphere and thermosphere based on UVIS stellar occultations and CIRS limb scans. The retrieved optical depths agree well with the magnitude and latitudinal structures predicted by the photochemical model, including a reduction in optical depth observed near the ring shadow in the winter hemisphere. Additionally, we identified seasonal variations in the hydrogen distribution, with a peak in upper atmospheric hydrogen observed between 10\u00b0-20\u00b0 N/S during their respective summer seasons.",

We constrain variations in disk brightness with latitude and local time, relating them to models of Saturn's upper atmosphere. We compare these results with Voyager observations of similar viewing geometry. The Cassini disk brightness is almost four time lower than the Voyager brightness. This difference cannot be explained by changes in the solar Lyman \u03b1 flux or atmospheric structure. The change in solar flux is modest and atmospheric structure retrieved from occultation data is relatively stable over time. The disk brightness observed by Cassini can be explained by resonant scattering of solar Lyman \u03b1 radiation and the best-fit hydrogen abundance in the thermosphere is consistent with atmospheric structure retrieved from the occultation data as well as photochemical model predictions. Our results support the recently proposed recalibration of the Voyager/UVS instruments that would bring the Voyager disk brightness in line with our model predictions and provide a consistent interpretation of Saturn Lyman \u03b1 emissions over time. We also explore the extended emission in the Saturn system, centered near the ring plane in edge-on viewing. The extended emission can be explained by a distribution of atomic hydrogen that is symmetric about the ring plane. We do not find evidence for a plume of hot hydrogen atoms escaping from Saturn's sunlit atmosphere that was proposed previously. Instead, the structure earlier interpreted as a plume is most simply explained by solar illumination from below the ring plane during southern summer combined with the edge-on viewing geometry.",

      "abstract": "Saturn's moon Mimas is on an inclined orbit with several strong vertical orbital resonances in Saturn's rings. The 5:3 inner vertical resonance with Mimas lies in the outer A ring and produces a prominent spiral bending wave (BW) that propagates away from Mimas. While dozens of density waves in Saturn's rings have been analyzed to determine local surface mass densities and viscosities, the number of bending waves is limited by the requirement for a moon on an inclined orbit and because, unlike the Lindblad resonances that excite density waves, there can be no first order vertical resonances. The Mimas 5:3 BW is the most prominent in the ring system. Bending wave theory was initially developed by Shu et al. (1983, Icarus, 53, 185-206) following the Voyager encounters with Saturn. Later, Gresh et al. (1986, Icarus, 68, 481-502) modeled radio science occultation data of the Mimas 5:3 BW with an imperfect fit to the theory. The multitude of high resolution stellar occultations observed by Cassini UVIS provides an opportunity to reconstruct the full three-dimensional structure of this wave and learn more about local ring properties. Occultations at high elevation angles out of the ring plane are insensitive to the wave structure due to the small angles of the vertical warping of the rings in the wave. They thus reveal the underlying structure in the wave region. There is a symmetric increase in optical depth throughout the Mimas 5:3 BW region. This may be due to an increase in the abundance of small particles without a corresponding increase in surface mass density. We include this feature in a ray-tracing model of the vertical structure of the wave and fit it to multiple UVIS occultations. The observed amplitude of the wave and its damping behavior of are not well-described by the Shu et al. model, which assumes a fluid-like damping mechanism. A different damping behavior of the ring, perhaps radially varying across the wave region due to differences in the particle size distribution and/or structure of the self-gravity wakes in the ring, is needed to match observations.",

Statistical moments of the data, such as the mean, variance, and skewness, provide a range of information about the structure of the rings, whether large-scale, small-scale, or in between. The mean signal of the HSP data is used to calculate the line-of-sight optical depth over the range sample, while the variance is used to infer an effective particle size (Showalter and Nicholson 1990 Icarus 87, 285; Colwell et al. 2018 Icarus 300, 150). The next-higher moment after variance, the skewness of the distribution of measured star brightnesses, is relatively insensitive to particle size but is strongly perturbed by the presence of even a small fractional coverage of openings dubbed \"ghosts\" in the rings that may be the result of miniature moonlets (Bailli\u00e9 et al. 2013, Astron. J. 145, 171). Comparisons between the skewness of the data as a function of optical depth provide insight about local structures within the rings, such as the presence of clumps and ghosts. We compare the observed distribution of skewness with those from simulated occultations from both Monte Carlo and dynamical N-body simulations of the rings. We present the lag in the autocorrelation of the occultation data to study variations in ring structure on the scale of several HSP measurement intervals (~100 m in ring plane radius). By analyzing these from occultations observed at different elevation angles to the rings we identify changes in the vertical structure of the rings across the ring system as well. We will present the results of our analyses of the UVIS data along with comparisons to the Monte Carlo and N-body simulations.",

      "abstract": "The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) included a High-Speed Photometer (HSP), which observed hundreds of stellar occultations by Saturn's ring system across a range of viewing geometries (Colwell et al. 2010). The unocculted time series data from the HSP follow Poisson counting statistics, such that the second and third central moments of the unocculted data should be equal to the mean photon rate of the star. When the star is occulted by the rings, the presence of ring particles introduces a correlation in the previously uncorrelated photons. This causes each of the central moments to deviate from their expected value. In particular, the second central moment, \u03bc2, commonly known as the variance, becomes greater than the mean (Colwell et al. 2018). The third central moment, \u03bc3, also deviates from this expectation upon occultation, but the nature of the deviation varies with optical depth. In particular, \u03bc3 is less than its Poisson expectation for \u03c4&lt;0.33 and greater than this expectation for \u03c4&gt;0.33. The introduction of outlier features, namely small gaps ('ghosts', Bailli\u00e9 et al. (2013)) and clumps produce variable effects on the behavior of both \u03bc2 and \u03bc3, which is also dependent on optical depth. We compare the higher-order moments from Monte Carlo Simulations of a simplified ring system to those from the UVIS data to gain insight into the nature of such outliers in the C ring and Cassini Division. The behavior of the data in the C ring plateaus indicates that a small population of \u223c 10-m ghosts exists in this region, with a frequency of about 1 ghost per km of radial extent. In the background C ring, we find that particle sizes are positively correlated with optical depth and the data cannot be explained with a simple power-law size distribution. Instead, we are able to describe the behavior of the higher-order moments using a bent-power law size distribution of particles. We find similar behavior in the C ring ramp and Cassini Division ramp. However, we cannot rule out nor confirm the presence of either ghosts or clumps in the background Cassini Division. In the Triple Band, the local \u223c 10-m ghost frequency oscillates between about 1 and 4 ghosts per km.",

But on scales smaller than a few tens of km yet still larger than the largest common ring particles, the assumption of azimuthal symmetry breaks down. Structures such as \"straw\" in the troughs of density waves, partial gaps around propeller moonlets, and ephemeral particle aggregates such as self-gravity wakes are responsible for the predominant variations in optical depth. During the 13 year Cassini mission, the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) high speed photometer (HSP) measured 80 stellar chord occultations of Saturn's main rings. In the vicinity of the minimum ring plane radius of each chord, the occultation line-of-sight slewed across the ring plane tangent to the Keplerian motion of the ring particles. These occultations measured ultraviolet light in the wavelength range 110\u2013190 nm with 1- or 2-ms ms integration times, providing optical depth measurements with resolution comparable to the Fresnel scale of <mml:math altimg=\"si1.svg\" display=\"inline\" id=\"d1e5821\"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>\u223c</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math> m in the frame co-moving with the local Keplerian speed.

We measure the length scale of transparent gaps and self-gravity wakes in the peaks and troughs of spiral density waves.

We combine autocorrelation length scales from stellar occultations which cut across the minimum ring radius of a chord occultation with line-of-sight trajectories from other occultations which are not tangent to the rings to constrain the morphology of the azimuthally and temporally averaged mesoscale structures at that ring radius. 2D autocorrelation profiles from stellar occultations show self-gravity wakes and axisymmetric waves often coexisting.",

A recent analysis of stellar occultations observed in 2016-2017 by the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) (see abstract by Z. Brown and colleagues from this meeting) has proven particularly instrumental in highlighting seasonal behavior in the upper stratosphere at pressures that are difficult to probe remotely by other methods. These observations exhibit variations with latitude that correlate with the actinic solar flux that drives photochemistry, as is expected from seasonal photochemical models, as well as highlight some unexpected behavior, such as trends in the methane homopause pressure level with latitude. To gain physical insights into the observed behavior, we have developed a time-variable photochemical model for Saturn's stratosphere and thermosphere. The model considers solar-driven coupled ion-neutral photochemistry and accounts for meridional and temporal variations in incident solar flux due to orbital and seasonal geometry, ring shadowing, and solar-cycle variations. Comparisons of the models with Cassini data (including a data set complementary to that of UVIS, consisting of Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) retrievals of hydrocarbon abundances deeper in the stratosphere) provide important clues to seasonally variable chemistry, dynamics, and haze formation in Saturn's stratosphere. The model-data comparisons confirm the importance of ion chemistry in producing benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Saturn's stratosphere and point to potential missing chemistry in the model, including auroral-induced ion chemistry, and an as-yet-unidentified process that increases C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB> production in Saturn's upper stratosphere above model predictions. We describe the model results, compare them with available spatially resolved observations, and discuss the implications. We also present low-latitude results that include the very large influx of external material, presumably from Saturn's rings, that was observed by the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) during the Grand Finale stage of the mission; we show how that incoming material affects the abundance of neutral and ionized species in Saturn's upper atmosphere. <P />This work was supported by the NASA Solar System Workings program, grant number 80NSSC20K0462.",
