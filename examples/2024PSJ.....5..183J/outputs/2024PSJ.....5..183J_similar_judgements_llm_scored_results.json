  "abstract": "Our understanding of solar system evolution is closely tied to interpretations of asteroid composition, particularly the M-class asteroids. These asteroids were initially thought to be the exposed cores of differentiated planetesimals, a hypothesis based on their spectral similarity to iron meteorites. However, recent astronomical observations have revealed hydration on their surface through the detection of 3 \u03bcm absorption features associated with OH and potentially H<SUB>2</SUB>O. We present evidence of hydration due mainly to OH on asteroid (16) Psyche, the largest M-class asteroid, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spanning 1.1\u20136.63 \u03bcm. Our observations include two detections of the full 3 \u03bcm feature associated with OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>O resembling those found in CY-, CH-, and CB-type carbonaceous chondrites, and no 6 \u03bcm feature uniquely associated with H<SUB>2</SUB>O across two observations. We observe 3 \u03bcm depths of between 4.3% and 6% across two observations, values consistent with hydrogen abundance estimates on other airless bodies of 250\u2013400 ppm. We place an upper limit of 39 ppm on the water abundance from the standard deviation around the 6 \u03bcm feature region. The presence of hydrated minerals suggests a complex history for Psyche. Exogenous sources of OH-bearing minerals could come from hydrated impactors. Endogenous OH-bearing minerals would indicate a composition more similar to E- or P-class asteroids. If the hydration is endogenous, it supports the theory that Psyche originated beyond the snow line and later migrated to the outer main belt.",

      "abstract": "Our understanding of Solar System evolution is intricately linked to the compositional analysis of asteroids, particularly the M-class asteroids. Originally believed to be the exposed metallic cores of differentiated planetesimals due to their spectral resemblance to iron meteorites, recent observations have challenged this view by revealing signs of hydration on their surfaces. These findings include the detection of 3-\u03bcm absorption features indicative of hydroxyl (OH) groups and possibly water (H<SUB>2</SUB>O). In our study, we utilize data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), covering the spectral range of 1.1 to 6.63 \u03bcm, to investigate the surface hydration of (16) Psyche, the largest known M-class asteroid and target of NASA's Psyche mission. Our analysis reveals two distinct instances of the complete 3-\u03bcm feature, commonly associated with OH and potentially H<SUB>2</SUB>O, resembling those observed in CY-, CH-, and CB-type carbonaceous chondrites. Conversely, we detected no unique 6-\u03bcm features that would indicate the presence of H<SUB>2</SUB>O. The observed 3-\u03bcm feature depths ranged from 4.3% to 6%, with hydrogen abundance estimates on similar airless bodies suggesting values between 250 and 400 ppm. We have established an upper limit of 39 ppm for water abundance based on the standard deviation around the 6-\u03bcm feature region. The detection of hydration on Psyche's surface suggests a complex history for Psyche, potentially involving both exogenous sources from hydrated impactors and/or processes that enabled Psyche to retain hydration during its formation. If the hydration is found to be endogenous, it supports the hypothesis that Psyche originated beyond the snow line before migrating to the outer main belt, thus indicating a composition more akin to E- or P-class asteroids. Additionally, we will be presenting new findings on whether the 3-\u03bcm feature varies across different locations on Psyche by conducting single spaxel sampling across its surface. These findings will provide additional evidence to distinguish between hypotheses for the source of Psyche's hydrated surface.",

However, recent advancements in astronomical observations have called this assumption into question with the detection of hydration on their surfaces.

Utilizing data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that spans the spectral range of 1.1 to 6.63 \u03bcm, our research examines surface hydration on (16) Psyche, the largest M-class asteroid and target of NASA's Psyche mission. Our results allow us to characterize the full 3-\u03bcm feature separated in time by half a rotation. This feature had a similar shape to features observed on CY-, CH-, and CB-type carbonaceous chondrites, while no 6-\u03bcm features uniquely indicative of H<SUB>2</SUB>O were observed. The depth of the 3-\u03bcm features ranged from 4.3% to 6%, with hydrogen abundance on comparable airless bodies estimated at 250 to 400 ppm. An upper limit of 39 ppm for water abundance was determined based on the variability within the 6-\u03bcm feature region. These findings of hydrated minerals point to a complex history for Psyche, possibly shaped by either external impacts with hydrated objects or endogenic hydration. If the hydration is endogenous, it supports the theory that Psyche originated beyond the snow line and later moved to the outer main belt, suggesting a composition closer to that of E- or P-class asteroids.

This absorption feature is inconsistent with these M-class asteroids being primarily Fe-Ni metal, which would be expected if they were remnant cores of disrupted differentiated objects. We also find that large ( D&gt;65 km) M asteroids are very likely to be hydrated (75%), while small ( D&lt;65 km) M asteroids are very unlikely to be hydrated (10%). We believe the interpretation most consistent with all data (astronomical, meteoritical, and geochemical modeling) holds the large M-class asteroids to be relatively primitive material perhaps akin to enstatite chondrites or salt-rich carbonaceous chondrites, with the iron meteorites found on Earth perhaps deriving from the smaller, anhydrous M asteroids.

M-type asteroids in particular potentially represent the exposed cores of differentiated planetesimals, but there is insufficient data to claim with certainty that these asteroids are purely metallic. Previous detections of hydration and phyllosilicates on their surfaces further complicate the assumed composition of these asteroids. We propose to observe (16) Psyche, the prototypical M-type asteroid and target of the upcoming NASA Discovery mission 'Psyche', to quantify the amount and variability of hydration present on (16) Psyche's surface and to unambiguously determine if the hydration is a result of hydroxyl or water molecules. Our program will obtain high SNR, high spectral resolution, near to mid-IR spectra of (16) Psyche to detect and contemporaneously observe the entire 3-micron and 6-micron absorption and emission bands attributed to hydroxyl and/or water, potentially uniquely identifying water for the first time. We propose to observe (16) Psyche with a total of two visits using the NIRSpec Integral Field Unit and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instruments to obtain spectra from two, distinct hemispherical regions and thereby measure any global variability of the hydration features. JWST's unique capability to measure the entire 3 and 6-micron bands on the largest M-type asteroid will unambiguously identify the presence of water or hydroxyl on (16) Psyche, constraining (16) Psyche's surface composition and impact history, providing critical context for the upcoming 'Psyche' mission and interpretations of hydration features observed on asteroids.",

Asteroid groups formerly associated with mineralogies assumed to have high-temperature formation, such as M- and E-class asteroids, have been observed to have hydration features in their reflectance spectra.

However, isotopic studies suggest that non-C materials may have played a significant role in delivering water to Earth, highlighting the need to better understand water distribution in these bodies. This study aims to assess the abundance and distribution of water in non-C complex asteroids using near-infrared spectra obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We propose to observe the 2.5\u20133.5 \u00b5m region with the NIRSpec/IFU; in this spectral range, diagnostic OH and H2O absorption features reveal key details about the mineralogy and speciation of hydrated phases. Critically, ground-based observations cannot access this region due to telluric absorptions, making JWST uniquely capable of capturing these diagnostic features. By studying these features, we aim to determine whether nominally anhydrous asteroids exhibit evidence of hydration and if OH/H2O abundance correlates with heliocentric distance. These observations will provide new insights into the diversity of water sources in the solar system, ultimately advancing our understanding of whether the early inner solar system contained sufficient water to contribute significantly to Earth's water supply.",

We would expect then to see a gradual decline of the abundance of hydrated minerals among the outer Main Belt asteroids with increasing heliocentric distance (2.5 &lt; a &lt; 4.0 AU). We measured spectra (0.8-2.5 \u03bcm and 1.9-4.1 \u03bcm) of 28 outer Main Belt asteroids using the SpeX spectrograph/imager at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). We identified four groups on the basis of the shape and the band center of the 3-\u03bcm feature. The first group, which we call \"sharp\", exhibits a sharp 3-\u03bcm feature, attributed to hydrated minerals (phyllosilicates). Most asteroids in this group are located in the 2.5 &lt; a &lt; 3.3 AU region. The second group, which we call \"Ceres-like\", consists of 10 Hygiea and 324 Bamberga. Like Asteroid Ceres, these asteroids exhibit a 3-\u03bcm feature with a band center of 3.05 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcm that is superimposed on a broader absorption feature from \u223c2.8 to 3.7 \u03bcm. The third group, which we call \"Europa-like\", includes 52 Europa, 31 Euphrosyne, and 451 Patientia. Objects in this group exhibit a 3-\u03bcm feature with a band center of 3.15 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcm. Both the Ceres-like and Europa-like groups are concentrated in the 2.5 &lt; a &lt; 3.3 AU region. The fourth group, which we call \"rounded\", is concentrated in the 3.4 &lt; a &lt; 4.0 AU region. Asteroids in this group are characterized by a rounded 3-\u03bcm feature, attributed to H<SUB>2</SUB>O ice. A similar rounded 3-\u03bcm feature was also identified in 24 Themis and 65 Cybele. Unlike the sharp group, the rounded group did not experience aqueous alteration.

      "abstract": "Recently published space-based observations of main-belt asteroids with the AKARI telescope provide a full description of the 3 \u03bcm band, related to the presence of OH bearing minerals. Here, we use laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites obtained under controlled atmosphere (CI,CM,CO,CV,CR Tagish Lake) to derive spectral metrics related to the water content in the samples. After testing several spectral metrics, we use a combination of band depth at 2.75 \u03bcm and 2.80 \u03bcm that shows a correlation with [H<SUB>2</SUB>O] in the sample determined by TGA, though with a high uncertainty (4 wt% H<SUB>2</SUB>O). This relation is used to determine water content at the surface of large C-complex main-belt asteroids and discuss the origin of the variability found. On average C-complex Main-Belt Asteroids (MBA) have water contents of 4.5 wt% (volume average, (1) Ceres excluded), significantly lower than average CM chondrites. The estimated water content for the most hydrated asteroids are lower than those of the most hydrated meteorites, a difference that could be attributed to space-weathering. An anti-correlation is also present between water content and overall spectral slope, which is opposite to expectation from laboratory simulations of space weathering on dark carbonaceous chondrites. This suggests that part of the variability in the surface hydration among the different C-complex asteroids is not due to space-weathering, but to the composition of surface material. When applied to Ceres, the hygrometer presented in this work enables us to estimate that at least 1.22 wt% of the hydrogen is present in the form of organics. This richness in organics strengthens the connection between Ceres and cometary materials.",

The NIRSpec observations were separated by ~1/2 of Psyche's rotation period, and the MIRI observations were separated by 5 days with a ~70% offset in rotation period. Psyche was nearly pole-on during these observations, and therefore the two visits associated with each instrument are not anticipated to reveal significantly different portions of the asteroid's surface. However, we were able to resolve Psyche across ~10 pixels in diameter, enabling identification of compositional variability across a single hemisphere within each observation. We will present on the current state of our ongoing analysis of potential 3 and 6-\u00b5m features observed along with their variation across Psyche's surface, and speculate on the implications for Psyche's composition, origin and evolution, and the broader context of these findings as they relate to M-type asteroids and the evolution of the solar system.",

Our NIRSpec data confirms that Phaethon's surface is dehydrated, showing no evidence of hydrated minerals in the 3 \u03bcm region. We estimate an upper limit on the hydrogen content in phyllosilicates of 0.06 wt%. Comparisons with laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites suggest that Phaethon's surface composition is best matched by thermally metamorphosed samples of the CM chondrite Murchison (heated to 1000 \u00b0C), rather than CY meteorites as previous work suggested. We find no evidence of ongoing surface evolution due to recent perihelion passages. A comparison of the mid-infrared spectra of Phaethon and Bennu shows distinct spectral differences that are consistent with their different thermal histories. Our findings further refine our understanding of Phaethon's current surface composition and evolution and provide additional insights for the upcoming DESTINY<SUP>+</SUP> mission.",

      "abstract": "The spectral characterization of small asteroids is important for understanding the evolution of their compositional and mineralogical properties. We report the results of a CCD spectroscopic survey of small main-belt asteroids which we call the Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey (SMASS). Spectra of 316 asteroids were obtained, with wavelength coverage ranging from 4000 to 10000 \u00c5 (0.4 to 1 \u03bcm). More than half of the objects in our survey have diameters less than 20 km. Survey results include the identification of the first object resembling ordinary chondrite meteorites among the main-belt asteroids (Binzel, R. P., S. Xu, S. J. Bus, M. F. Skrutskie, M. R. Meyer, P. Knezek, and E. S. Barker 1993a. Science 262, 1541-1543) and observations of more than 20 asteroids showing basaltic achondrite spectral absorption features that strongly link Vesta as the parent body for the basaltic achondrite meteorites (Binzel, R. P., and S. Xu 1993. Science 260, 186-191). A potential Mars-crossing asteroid analog to ordinary chondrite meteorites (H chondrites), 2078 Nanking, is reported here. Through a principal component analysis, we have assigned classifications to the members of our sample. The majority of the small main-belt asteroids belong to S and C classes, similar to large asteroids. Our analysis shows that two new classes are justified which we label as J and O. Small asteroids display more diversity in spectral absorption features than the larger ones, which may indicate a greater variation of compositions in the small asteroid population. We found a few candidates for olivine-rich asteroids within the S class. Although the total number of olivine-rich candidates is relatively small, we present evidence suggesting that such objects are more prevalent at smaller sizes.",

      "abstract": "Most chondrite parent bodies accreted water ice together with anhydrous minerals and subsequently experienced aqueous/hydrothermal alteration and fluid-assisted thermal metamorphism, resulting in formation of a diverse suite of secondary minerals. The 53Mn-53Cr chronology of datable secondary minerals indicates aqueous activity on the ordinary (OC) and carbonaceous chondrite (CC) parent bodies started ~3-5 m.y. after the beginning of the solar system formation (t0), consistent with 26Al being the major heat source of these bodies. The 53Mn-53Cr ages of aqueous alteration, the 26Al-26Mg ages of chondrule formation, and the peak metamorphic temperatures reached by the OC and CC parent bodies suggest that they accreted ~2.0-4 m.y. after t0. There are significant variations in the degree of aqueous alteration within and between different chondrite groups, possibly due to the heterogeneous distribution of water ice in their parent bodies. The CI (Ivuna-type) carbonaceous chondrites that are composed almost entirely of aqueously formed minerals are the only exception. The estimated water ice-to-rock mass ratios in OC and CC parent bodies range from &lt;0.1 to ~0.6 (could be higher in CIs), which is significantly lower than the solar value of 1.2. We suggest that most chondrite parent bodies accreted close to the snow line; CIs may have accreted further away from the Sun than other chondrite groups. Because the snow line for the 2.5\u22124-m.y.-old disk is expected to be within 2\u22123 AU of the Sun, we conclude that chondrite parent bodies are sampled by meteorites accreted in the main asteroid belt, consistent with the inferred deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratio of asteroidal water. The existing meteorite observations provide no clear evidence supporting the predictions of the Grand Tack and Nice dynamical models of the solar system evolution, wherein hydrated asteroids formed between and beyond giant planets and were subsequently implanted into the main asteroid belt during migration of the giant planets. We note, however, that there could be other types of hydrated or water-ice-bearing planetesimals that were implanted into the main asteroid belt, but have not been sampled by the known meteorites.",

      "abstract": "This work focuses on the study of the aqueous alteration process which acted in the main belt and produced hydrated minerals on the altered asteroids. Hydrated minerals have been found mainly on Mars surface, on main belt primitive asteroids and possibly also on few TNOs. These materials have been produced by hydration of pristine anhydrous silicates during the aqueous alteration process, that, to be active, needed the presence of liquid water under low temperature conditions (below 320 K) to chemically alter the minerals. The aqueous alteration is particularly important for unraveling the processes occurring during the earliest times of the Solar System history, as it can give information both on the asteroids thermal evolution and on the localization of water sources in the asteroid belt. <P />To investigate this process, we present reflected light spectral observations in the visible region (0.4-0.94 \u03bcm) of 80 asteroids belonging to the primitive classes C (prevalently), G, F, B and P, following the Tholen (Tholen, D.J. [1984]. Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Arizona, Tucson). classification scheme. We find that about 65% of the C-type and all the G-type asteroids investigated reveal features suggesting the presence of hydrous materials, mainly a band centered around 0.7 \u03bcm, while we do not find evidence of hydrated materials in the other low albedo asteroids (B, F, and P) investigated. <P />We combine the present observations with the visible spectra of asteroids available in the literature for a total of 600 primitive main belt asteroids. We analyze all these spectra in a similar way to characterize the absorption band parameters (band center, depth and width) and spectral slope, and to look for possible correlations between the aqueous alteration process and the asteroids taxonomic classes, orbital elements, heliocentric distances, albedo and sizes. Our analysis shows that the aqueous alteration sequence starts from the P-type objects, practically unaltered, and increases through the P \u2192 F \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 G asteroids, these last being widely aqueous altered, strengthening thus the results previously obtained by Vilas (Vilas, F. [1994]. Icarus 111, 456-467). Around 50% of the observed C-type asteroids show absorption feature in the visible range due to hydrated silicates, implying that more than \u223c70% of them will have a 3 \u03bcm absorption band and thus hydrated minerals on their surfaces, based on correlations between those two absorptions (Howell, E.S. et al. [2011]. EPSC-DPS Joint Meeting 2011, vol. 6. Abstracts, 637). <P />We find that the aqueous alteration process dominates in primitive asteroids located between 2.3 and 3.1 AU, that is at smaller heliocentric distances than previously suggested by Vilas et al. (Vilas, F., Hatch, E.C., Larson, S.M., Sawyer, S.R., Gaffey, M.J. [1993]. Icarus 102, 225-231). The percentage of hydrated asteroids is strongly correlated with their size. The aqueous alteration process is less effective for bodies smaller than 50 km, while it dominates in the 50-240 km sized primitive asteroids. <P />No correlation is found between the aqueous alteration process and the asteroids albedo or orbital elements. Comparing the \u223c0.7 \u03bcm band parameters of hydrated silicates and CM2 carbonaceous chondrites, the meteorites that have aqueous altered asteroids as parent bodies, we see that the band center of meteorites is at longer wavelengths than that of asteroids. This difference on center positions may be attributed to different minerals abundances, and to the fact that CM2 available on Earth might not be representative of the whole aqueous altered asteroids population.",

Their reflectance spectra all have very similar absorptions centered near 2.72 \u03bcm attributed to Mg\u2013OH in minerals. Within this band, Pallas also shows evidence of a sharper, deeper band, also centered near 2.72 \u03bcm. These band positions are similar to those seen in the most aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites and samples from Ryugu and Bennu. Absorptions in the 2.7\u20132.9 \u03bcm region due to other cation\u2013OH combinations are weak, if present. The NIRSpec spectrum of Ceres is consistent with the global average spectrum of Dawn, and the similarity between Ceres and Hygiea seen in other wavelength regions continues into the 2.5\u20132.8 \u03bcm region. This similarity in spectral properties, and thus in interpretations of surface composition, implies that the two bodies may have had similar processes occur and similar histories. This suggests that Hygiea, similar to Ceres, may be associated with the \"ocean worlds\" despite its relatively small mass. Quantitative estimates of the hydrogen concentrations on the surfaces suggest hydrogen concentrations of roughly 0.5\u20131 wt%, consistent with CM chondrites. Additional absorptions attributed to ammoniated minerals are seen in Ceres's and Hygiea's spectra, as has been reported by others, but are not seen in Pallas's spectrum. Absorptions are also seen in the 2.5\u20132.7 \u03bcm region in all three asteroids, likely due to OH combination bands, and from roughly 3.9 to 4.3 \u03bcm in Hygiea, which could be due to carbonates plus an unidentified constituent.",

These low \u025b <SUB>W</SUB> values may in part reflect <SUP>182</SUP>W-burnout caused by the prolonged cosmic ray exposure of iron meteorites, but this effect is estimated to be less than \u223c0.3 \u025b units for an exposure age of 600 Ma. The W isotope data, after correction for cosmic ray induced effects, indicate that core formation in the parent asteroids of the magmatic iron meteorites occurred less than \u223c1.5 Myr after formation of CAIs. The nonmagmatic IAB-IIICD irons and the metal-rich CB chondrites have more radiogenic W isotope compositions, indicating formation several Myr after the oldest metal cores had segregated in some asteroids. Chondrule formation \u223c2-5 Myr after CAIs, as constrained by published Pb-Pb and Al-Mg ages, postdates core formation in planetesimals, and indicates that chondrites do not represent the precursor material from which asteroids accreted and then differentiated. Chondrites instead derive from asteroids that accreted late, either farther from the Sun than the parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites or by reaccretion of debris produced during collisional disruption of older asteroids. Alternatively, chondrites may represent material from the outermost layers of differentiated asteroids. The early thermal and chemical evolution of asteroids appears to be controlled by the decay of <SUP>26</SUP>Al, which was sufficiently abundant (initial <SUP>26</SUP>Al/ <SUP>27</SUP>Al &gt;1.4 \u00d7 10 <SUP>-5</SUP>) to rapidly melt early-formed planetesimals but could not raise the temperatures in the late-formed chondrite parent asteroids high enough to cause differentiation.
