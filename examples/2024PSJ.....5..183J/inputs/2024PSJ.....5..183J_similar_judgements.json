These asteroids were initially thought to be the exposed cores of differentiated planetesimals, a hypothesis based on their spectral similarity to iron meteorites. However, recent astronomical observations have revealed hydration on their surface through the detection of 3 \u03bcm absorption features associated with OH and potentially H<SUB>2</SUB>O. We present evidence of hydration due mainly to OH on asteroid (16) Psyche, the largest M-class asteroid, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spanning 1.1\u20136.63 \u03bcm. Our observations include two detections of the full 3 \u03bcm feature associated with OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>O resembling those found in CY-, CH-, and CB-type carbonaceous chondrites, and no 6 \u03bcm feature uniquely associated with H<SUB>2</SUB>O across two observations. We observe 3 \u03bcm depths of between 4.3% and 6% across two observations, values consistent with hydrogen abundance estimates on other airless bodies of 250\u2013400 ppm. We place an upper limit of 39 ppm on the water abundance from the standard deviation around the 6 \u03bcm feature region. The presence of hydrated minerals suggests a complex history for Psyche. Exogenous sources of OH-bearing minerals could come from hydrated impactors. Endogenous OH-bearing minerals would indicate a composition more similar to E- or P-class asteroids. If the hydration is endogenous, it supports the theory that Psyche originated beyond the snow line and later migrated to the outer main belt.",

Originally believed to be the exposed metallic cores of differentiated planetesimals due to their spectral resemblance to iron meteorites, recent observations have challenged this view by revealing signs of hydration on their surfaces. These findings include the detection of 3-\u03bcm absorption features indicative of hydroxyl (OH) groups and possibly water (H<SUB>2</SUB>O). In our study, we utilize data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), covering the spectral range of 1.1 to 6.63 \u03bcm, to investigate the surface hydration of (16) Psyche, the largest known M-class asteroid and target of NASA's Psyche mission. Our analysis reveals two distinct instances of the complete 3-\u03bcm feature, commonly associated with OH and potentially H<SUB>2</SUB>O, resembling those observed in CY-, CH-, and CB-type carbonaceous chondrites. Conversely, we detected no unique 6-\u03bcm features that would indicate the presence of H<SUB>2</SUB>O. The observed 3-\u03bcm feature depths ranged from 4.3% to 6%, with hydrogen abundance estimates on similar airless bodies suggesting values between 250 and 400 ppm. We have established an upper limit of 39 ppm for water abundance based on the standard deviation around the 6-\u03bcm feature region. The detection of hydration on Psyche's surface suggests a complex history for Psyche, potentially involving both exogenous sources from hydrated impactors and/or processes that enabled Psyche to retain hydration during its formation. If the hydration is found to be endogenous, it supports the hypothesis that Psyche originated beyond the snow line before migrating to the outer main belt, thus indicating a composition more akin to E- or P-class asteroids. Additionally, we will be presenting new findings on whether the 3-\u03bcm feature varies across different locations on Psyche by conducting single spaxel sampling across its surface. These findings will provide additional evidence to distinguish between hypotheses for the source of Psyche's hydrated surface.",

We believe the interpretation most consistent with all data (astronomical, meteoritical, and geochemical modeling) holds the large M-class asteroids to be relatively primitive material perhaps akin to enstatite chondrites or salt-rich carbonaceous chondrites, with the iron meteorites found on Earth perhaps deriving from the smaller, anhydrous M asteroids.

Observations in those regions show that hydrated minerals are common in the mid-asteroid belt, and can be found in unexpected spectral groupings as well. Asteroid groups formerly associated with mineralogies assumed to have high-temperature formation, such as M- and E-class asteroids, have been observed to have hydration features in their reflectance spectra. Some asteroids have apparently been heated to several hundred degrees Celsius, enough to destroy some fraction of their phyllosilicates.

However, isotopic studies suggest that non-C materials may have played a significant role in delivering water to Earth, highlighting the need to better understand water distribution in these bodies. This study aims to assess the abundance and distribution of water in non-C complex asteroids using near-infrared spectra obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We propose to observe the 2.5\u20133.5 \u00b5m region with the NIRSpec/IFU; in this spectral range, diagnostic OH and H2O absorption features reveal key details about the mineralogy and speciation of hydrated phases. Critically, ground-based observations cannot access this region due to telluric absorptions, making JWST uniquely capable of capturing these diagnostic features. By studying these features, we aim to determine whether nominally anhydrous asteroids exhibit evidence of hydration and if OH/H2O abundance correlates with heliocentric distance. These observations will provide new insights into the diversity of water sources in the solar system, ultimately advancing our understanding of whether the early inner solar system contained sufficient water to contribute significantly to Earth's water supply.",

We would expect then to see a gradual decline of the abundance of hydrated minerals among the outer Main Belt asteroids with increasing heliocentric distance (2.5 &lt; a &lt; 4.0 AU). We measured spectra (0.8-2.5 \u03bcm and 1.9-4.1 \u03bcm) of 28 outer Main Belt asteroids using the SpeX spectrograph/imager at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). We identified four groups on the basis of the shape and the band center of the 3-\u03bcm feature. The first group, which we call \"sharp\", exhibits a sharp 3-\u03bcm feature, attributed to hydrated minerals (phyllosilicates). Most asteroids in this group are located in the 2.5 &lt; a &lt; 3.3 AU region. The second group, which we call \"Ceres-like\", consists of 10 Hygiea and 324 Bamberga.

Here, we use laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites obtained under controlled atmosphere (CI,CM,CO,CV,CR Tagish Lake) to derive spectral metrics related to the water content in the samples. After testing several spectral metrics, we use a combination of band depth at 2.75 \u03bcm and 2.80 \u03bcm that shows a correlation with [H<SUB>2</SUB>O] in the sample determined by TGA, though with a high uncertainty (4 wt% H<SUB>2</SUB>O). This relation is used to determine water content at the surface of large C-complex main-belt asteroids and discuss the origin of the variability found. On average C-complex Main-Belt Asteroids (MBA) have water contents of 4.5 wt% (volume average, (1) Ceres excluded), significantly lower than average CM chondrites. The estimated water content for the most hydrated asteroids are lower than those of the most hydrated meteorites, a difference that could be attributed to space-weathering. An anti-correlation is also present between water content and overall spectral slope, which is opposite to expectation from laboratory simulations of space weathering on dark carbonaceous chondrites. This suggests that part of the variability in the surface hydration among the different C-complex asteroids is not due to space-weathering, but to the composition of surface material. When applied to Ceres, the hygrometer presented in this work enables us to estimate that at least 1.22 wt% of the hydrogen is present in the form of organics. This richness in organics strengthens the connection between Ceres and cometary materials.",

The 53Mn-53Cr chronology of datable secondary minerals indicates aqueous activity on the ordinary (OC) and carbonaceous chondrite (CC) parent bodies started ~3-5 m.y. after the beginning of the solar system formation (t0), consistent with 26Al being the major heat source of these bodies. The 53Mn-53Cr ages of aqueous alteration, the 26Al-26Mg ages of chondrule formation, and the peak metamorphic temperatures reached by the OC and CC parent bodies suggest that they accreted ~2.0-4 m.y. after t0. There are significant variations in the degree of aqueous alteration within and between different chondrite groups, possibly due to the heterogeneous distribution of water ice in their parent bodies. The CI (Ivuna-type) carbonaceous chondrites that are composed almost entirely of aqueously formed minerals are the only exception. The estimated water ice-to-rock mass ratios in OC and CC parent bodies range from &lt;0.1 to ~0.6 (could be higher in CIs), which is significantly lower than the solar value of 1.2. We suggest that most chondrite parent bodies accreted close to the snow line; CIs may have accreted further away from the Sun than other chondrite groups. Because the snow line for the 2.5\u22124-m.y.-old disk is expected to be within 2\u22123 AU of the Sun, we conclude that chondrite parent bodies are sampled by meteorites accreted in the main asteroid belt, consistent with the inferred deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratio of asteroidal water. The existing meteorite observations provide no clear evidence supporting the predictions of the Grand Tack and Nice dynamical models of the solar system evolution, wherein hydrated asteroids formed between and beyond giant planets and were subsequently implanted into the main asteroid belt during migration of the giant planets. We note, however, that there could be other types of hydrated or water-ice-bearing planetesimals that were implanted into the main asteroid belt, but have not been sampled by the known meteorites.",

      "abstract": "This work focuses on the study of the aqueous alteration process which acted in the main belt and produced hydrated minerals on the altered asteroids. Hydrated minerals have been found mainly on Mars surface, on main belt primitive asteroids and possibly also on few TNOs. These materials have been produced by hydration of pristine anhydrous silicates during the aqueous alteration process, that, to be active, needed the presence of liquid water under low temperature conditions (below 320 K) to chemically alter the minerals. The aqueous alteration is particularly important for unraveling the processes occurring during the earliest times of the Solar System history, as it can give information both on the asteroids thermal evolution and on the localization of water sources in the asteroid belt. <P />To investigate this process, we present reflected light spectral observations in the visible region (0.4-0.94 \u03bcm) of 80 asteroids belonging to the primitive classes C (prevalently), G, F, B and P, following the Tholen (Tholen, D.J. [1984]. Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Arizona, Tucson). classification scheme. We find that about 65% of the C-type and all the G-type asteroids investigated reveal features suggesting the presence of hydrous materials, mainly a band centered around 0.7 \u03bcm, while we do not find evidence of hydrated materials in the other low albedo asteroids (B, F, and P) investigated. <P />We combine the present observations with the visible spectra of asteroids available in the literature for a total of 600 primitive main belt asteroids. We analyze all these spectra in a similar way to characterize the absorption band parameters (band center, depth and width) and spectral slope, and to look for possible correlations between the aqueous alteration process and the asteroids taxonomic classes, orbital elements, heliocentric distances, albedo and sizes. Our analysis shows that the aqueous alteration sequence starts from the P-type objects, practically unaltered, and increases through the P \u2192 F \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 G asteroids, these last being widely aqueous altered, strengthening thus the results previously obtained by Vilas (Vilas, F. [1994]. Icarus 111, 456-467). Around 50% of the observed C-type asteroids show absorption feature in the visible range due to hydrated silicates, implying that more than \u223c70% of them will have a 3 \u03bcm absorption band and thus hydrated minerals on their surfaces, based on correlations between those two absorptions (Howell, E.S. et al. [2011]. EPSC-DPS Joint Meeting 2011, vol. 6. Abstracts, 637). <P />We find that the aqueous alteration process dominates in primitive asteroids located between 2.3 and 3.1 AU, that is at smaller heliocentric distances than previously suggested by Vilas et al. (Vilas, F., Hatch, E.C., Larson, S.M., Sawyer, S.R., Gaffey, M.J. [1993]. Icarus 102, 225-231). The percentage of hydrated asteroids is strongly correlated with their size. The aqueous alteration process is less effective for bodies smaller than 50 km, while it dominates in the 50-240 km sized primitive asteroids. <P />No correlation is found between the aqueous alteration process and the asteroids albedo or orbital elements. Comparing the \u223c0.7 \u03bcm band parameters of hydrated silicates and CM2 carbonaceous chondrites, the meteorites that have aqueous altered asteroids as parent bodies, we see that the band center of meteorites is at longer wavelengths than that of asteroids. This difference on center positions may be attributed to different minerals abundances, and to the fact that CM2 available on Earth might not be representative of the whole aqueous altered asteroids population.",

These band positions are similar to those seen in the most aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites and samples from Ryugu and Bennu. Absorptions in the 2.7\u20132.9 \u03bcm region due to other cation\u2013OH combinations are weak, if present. The NIRSpec spectrum of Ceres is consistent with the global average spectrum of Dawn, and the similarity between Ceres and Hygiea seen in other wavelength regions continues into the 2.5\u20132.8 \u03bcm region. This similarity in spectral properties, and thus in interpretations of surface composition, implies that the two bodies may have had similar processes occur and similar histories. This suggests that Hygiea, similar to Ceres, may be associated with the \"ocean worlds\" despite its relatively small mass. Quantitative estimates of the hydrogen concentrations on the surfaces suggest hydrogen concentrations of roughly 0.5\u20131 wt%, consistent with CM chondrites. Additional absorptions attributed to ammoniated minerals are seen in Ceres's and Hygiea's spectra, as has been reported by others, but are not seen in Pallas's spectrum. Absorptions are also seen in the 2.5\u20132.7 \u03bcm region in all three asteroids, likely due to OH combination bands, and from roughly 3.9 to 4.3 \u03bcm in Hygiea, which could be due to carbonates plus an unidentified constituent.",

A regression of the Hf-W data for two bulk CAIs, various fragments of a single CAI, and carbonaceous chondrites constrains the <SUP>182</SUP>Hf/ <SUP>180</SUP>Hf and \u025b <SUB>W</SUB> at the time of CAI formation to (1.07 \u00b1 0.10) \u00d7 10 <SUP>-4</SUP> and -3.47 \u00b1 0.20, respectively. All magmatic iron meteorites examined here have initial \u025b <SUB>W</SUB> values that are similar to or slightly lower than the initial value of CAIs. These low \u025b <SUB>W</SUB> values may in part reflect <SUP>182</SUP>W-burnout caused by the prolonged cosmic ray exposure of iron meteorites, but this effect is estimated to be less than \u223c0.3 \u025b units for an exposure age of 600 Ma. The W isotope data, after correction for cosmic ray induced effects, indicate that core formation in the parent asteroids of the magmatic iron meteorites occurred less than \u223c1.5 Myr after formation of CAIs. The nonmagmatic IAB-IIICD irons and the metal-rich CB chondrites have more radiogenic W isotope compositions, indicating formation several Myr after the oldest metal cores had segregated in some asteroids. Chondrule formation \u223c2-5 Myr after CAIs, as constrained by published Pb-Pb and Al-Mg ages, postdates core formation in planetesimals, and indicates that chondrites do not represent the precursor material from which asteroids accreted and then differentiated. Chondrites instead derive from asteroids that accreted late, either farther from the Sun than the parent bodies of magmatic iron meteorites or by reaccretion of debris produced during collisional disruption of older asteroids. Alternatively, chondrites may represent material from the outermost layers of differentiated asteroids. The early thermal and chemical evolution of asteroids appears to be controlled by the decay of <SUP>26</SUP>Al, which was sufficiently abundant (initial <SUP>26</SUP>Al/ <SUP>27</SUP>Al &gt;1.4 \u00d7 10 <SUP>-5</SUP>) to rapidly melt early-formed planetesimals but could not raise the temperatures in the late-formed chondrite parent asteroids high enough to cause differentiation. The preservation of the primitive appearance of chondrites thus at least partially reflects their late formation rather than their early and primitive origin.",

      "abstract": "The JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS) aims to understand the evolution of the chemistry of inner protoplanetary disks using the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With a growing sample of &gt;30 disks, the survey implements a custom method to calibrate the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) to contrasts of better than 1:300 across its 4.9\u201328 \u03bcm spectral range. This is achieved using observations of Themis family asteroids as precise empirical reference sources. The high spectral contrast enables precise retrievals of physical parameters, searches for rare molecular species and isotopologues, and constraints on the inventories of carbon- and nitrogen-bearing species. JDISCS also offers significant improvements to the MRS wavelength and resolving power calibration. We describe the JDISCS calibrated data and demonstrate their quality using observations of the disk around the solar-mass young star FZ Tau. The FZ Tau MIRI spectrum is dominated by strong emission from warm water vapor. We show that the water and CO line emission originates from the disk surface and traces a range of gas temperatures of \u223c500\u20131500 K. We retrieve parameters for the observed CO and H<SUB>2</SUB>O lines and show that they are consistent with a radial distribution represented by two temperature components. A high water abundance of n(H<SUB>2</SUB>O) \u223c 10<SUP>\u20114</SUP> fills the disk surface at least out to the 350 K isotherm at 1.5 au. We search the FZ Tau environs for extended emission, detecting a large (radius of \u223c300 au) ring of emission from H<SUB>2</SUB> gas surrounding FZ Tau, and discuss its origin.",

      "abstract": "We present the transmission spectrum of the original transiting hot Jupiter HD 209458b from 2.3 to 5.1 \u03bcm as observed with the NIRCam instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Previous studies of HD 209458b's atmosphere have given conflicting results on the abundance of H<SUB>2</SUB>O and the presence of carbon- and nitrogen-bearing species, which have significant ramifications on the inferences of the planet's metallicity (M/H) and carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. We detect strong features of H<SUB>2</SUB>O and CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the JWST transmission spectrum, which when interpreted using a retrieval that assumes thermochemical equilibrium and fractional gray cloud opacity yields ${3}_{-1}^{+4}$ \u00d7 solar metallicity and C/O = ${0.11}_{-0.06}^{+0.12}$ . The derived metallicity is consistent with the atmospheric metallicity\u2013planet mass trend observed in solar gas giants. The low C/O ratio suggests that this planet has undergone significant contamination by evaporating planetesimals while migrating inward. We are also able to place upper limits on the abundances of CH<SUB>4</SUB>, C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>, and HCN of log( ${\\chi }_{{\\mathrm{CH}}_{4}}$ ) = \u20115.6, log( ${\\chi }_{{{\\rm{C}}}_{2}{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ ) = \u20115.7, and log( ${\\chi }_{\\mathrm{HCN}}$ ) = \u20115.1, which are in tension with the recent claim of a detection of these species using ground-based cross-correlation spectroscopy. We find that HD 209458b has a weaker CO<SUB>2</SUB> feature size than WASP-39b when comparing their scale-height-normalized transmission spectra. On the other hand, the size of HD 209458b's H<SUB>2</SUB>O feature is stronger, thus reinforcing the low C/O inference.",

We used the Near-Infrared Spectrograph and Mid-Infrared Instrument instruments on JWST to measure the 0.6-5 and 5-20 \u03bcm spectra of Didymos approximately two months after the DART impact. These observations confirm that Didymos belongs to the S asteroid class and is most consistent with LL chondrite composition, as was previously determined from its 0.6-2.5 \u03bcm reflectance spectrum. Measurements at wavelengths &gt;2.5 \u03bcm show Didymos to have thermal properties typical for an S-complex asteroid of its size and to be lacking absorptions deeper than ~2% due to OH or H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Didymos' mid-infrared emissivity spectrum is within the range of what has been measured on S-complex asteroids observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope and is most consistent with emission from small (&lt;25 \u03bcm) surface particles. We conclude that the observed reflectance and physical properties make the Didymos system a good proxy for the type of ordinary chondrite asteroids that cross near-Earth space, and a good representative of likely future impactors.",

The other 5 asteroids have no 3-\u03bcm absorption greater than 2% in intensity. The strength of the \"water\" feature in the spectra correlates positively with the strength of the UV absorption feature shortward of 0.4 \u03bcm, and negatively with the slope of the continuum between 1.2 and 2.2 \u03bcm. These correlations are the same as those seen in laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites, whose silicate compositions range from hydrated phyllosilicates to anhydrous olivine. We find no correlation between composition and semimajor axis for C asteroids as a class.
